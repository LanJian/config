2014-06-13 09:48:36	m625[POR]	you can't be offside on a corner
2014-06-13 09:48:47	slothzenusa	the first one, you can maybe see how he called it, the 2nd one was clearly onside, no question.
2014-06-13 09:48:48	drappy	or a throw in.
2014-06-13 09:48:48	m625[POR]	and the only person that touched the ball was a cameroon player
2014-06-13 09:48:57	raphaelsc	Cam's player deviated the ball, and Dos Santos was in a clear good position.

2014-06-13 09:49:28	m625[POR]	I don't understand why you'd ever think it was offside
2014-06-13 09:49:42	m625[POR]	a mexican player would have needed to touch the ball
2014-06-13 09:49:47	m625[POR]	for it to be offside

2014-06-13 17:50:41	m625[POR]	that's one club
2014-06-13 17:50:41	FIFOd	The closest mls team from me is 5 hours

2014-06-13 17:51:17	m625[POR]	some of the larger european clubs have a ton more iirc
2014-06-13 17:51:28	FIFOd	We don't even have clubs like that in America at all
2014-06-13 17:51:30	dt3k[MURICA]	m625[POR]:  Are there any other countries that have 4-5 major sports leagues tho?  MLB, NFL, NHL, MLS, NBA, etc?
2014-06-13 17:51:35	m625[POR]	yes
2014-06-13 17:51:45	flobin	FIFOd: 2-0 Costa Rica? Really?
2014-06-13 17:51:49	alecksi	spain maybe
2014-06-13 17:51:53	m625[POR]	nfl by and far is biggest sport in the US
2014-06-13 17:51:53	FIFOd	oops, meant Uruguay

2014-06-13 17:52:07	flobin	okay good :P
2014-06-13 17:52:16	FIFOd	nfl is not a concern, they will slowly bash each to death via head trauma
2014-06-13 17:52:28	alecksi	nfl will remain popular
2014-06-13 17:52:29	m625[POR]	but for example in portugal you have. Soccer obviously then you have Basketball, Roller Hockey and Handball
2014-06-13 17:52:29	flobin	hmm
2014-06-13 17:52:36	m625[POR]	those are all shown regularly on tv
2014-06-13 17:52:40	flobin	I think England - Italy will be interesting
2014-06-13 17:52:43	flobin	totally no clue there
2014-06-13 17:52:43	dt3k[MURICA]	m625[POR]: the nfl is by far the most valuable sports league in the world.  If you look at the financial data Forbes just published for 2014 every NFL team is in the top 50 except for 2.  Something like 30 out 50 NFL teams are the most valuable teams in the world.
2014-06-13 17:52:53	FIFOd	England v. Italy will certainly be the big game tomorrow
2014-06-13 17:52:59	alecksi	collegiate american football is way too big for americans to lose interest in

2014-06-13 17:53:57	flobin	the value of an NFL team
2014-06-13 17:54:03	m625[POR]	it's based on what they sell for
2014-06-13 17:54:09	m625[POR]	and inflation
2014-06-13 17:54:12	flobin	especially because the leage is the corporation, right

2014-06-15 10:44:39	kikkit	pifon in group they go by points & gd
2014-06-15 10:44:44	Wardje	pifon: extra time/penalties is for knockout phase, group phase is groups of 4 and you get 3 points for win, 1 for draw 0 for loss. First two of each group (16 countries total) go through to knockout
2014-06-15 10:44:45	kikkit	so a draw is still 1 point

2014-06-16 12:32:28	m625[POR]	There's just one problem—you won't be able to use them at the games. Brazil and FIFA drastically underestimated fans' propensity to throw things: In an April 2013 match where fans were given free caxirolas, they eventually pelted the field with the noisemakers.

2014-06-16 12:50:08	Wardje	m625[POR]: real easy to scrape, their page is nicely organized
2014-06-16 12:50:10	rchase	bosnia is a metropolitan nation, and quite well to do actually

2014-06-16 12:50:25	m625[POR]	nice either way
2014-06-16 12:50:32	Wardje	whoateallthepies: it matched 20140[67]\d\d for dates

2014-06-16 12:50:56	flobin	what do you guys think is the chance that Robben is doping
2014-06-16 12:50:57	Myakyu[USA]	i'd score
2014-06-16 12:51:04	[Persia]bortion	would both teams being bad make it more llikely to be goalless
2014-06-16 12:51:10	whoateallthepies	hah, ok, then that year really is silly :-P
2014-06-16 12:51:12	Wardje	yuh it's great, was like no effort at all to parse, should've done it the first day
2014-06-16 12:51:14	[Persia]bortion	wouldn't it still be as likely as not for someone to score
2014-06-16 12:51:16	rchase	RObben is not doping... thoug hhis performance was a bit addled
2014-06-16 12:51:22	rchase	if excellent
2014-06-16 12:51:26	Wardje	whoateallthepies: Ye I realized when I pushed it to the bot, now too lazy to go fix ti xD
2014-06-16 12:51:29	flobin	rchase: he ran SO fast though
2014-06-16 12:51:31	flobin	at his age
2014-06-16 12:51:33	[Persia]bortion	have any soccer players been caught doping
2014-06-16 12:51:34	whoateallthepies	he only dopes his left foot
2014-06-16 12:51:35	rchase	yeah, I know...
2014-06-16 12:51:37	[Persia]bortion	how bad is doping in soccer
2014-06-16 12:51:40	Wardje	whoateallthepies: maybe tomorrow I'll make it optional
2014-06-16 12:51:40	flobin	just makes me wodner
2014-06-16 12:51:40	flobin	wonder*
2014-06-16 12:51:41	[Persia]bortion	how is FIFA with the dope checks
2014-06-16 12:51:44	rchase	almost too fast... I get your point
2014-06-16 12:51:48	flobin	yeah
2014-06-16 12:52:00	rchase	FIFA... doping... do we want to go there?
2014-06-16 12:52:06	[Persia]bortion	ya
2014-06-16 12:52:08	[Persia]bortion	that's why I'm asking
2014-06-16 12:52:15	flobin	heh
2014-06-16 12:52:18	[Persia]bortion	I only know the doping situation in two sports: tennis and figure skating
2014-06-16 12:52:21	Hohoras	blatter is always on dope
2014-06-16 12:52:21	[Persia]bortion	no idea what happens in soccer
2014-06-16 12:52:29	rchase	oh, you mean _all sports_?
2014-06-16 12:52:31	[Persia]bortion	in tennis dope checks are very spotty and inadequate
2014-06-16 12:52:32	Wardje	I think doping checks happen, but nowhere near the levels of what they do in cycling
2014-06-16 12:52:42	[Persia]bortion	well is it adequate Wardje
2014-06-16 12:52:47	[Persia]bortion	have any prominent ballers been caught doping
2014-06-16 12:52:51	whoateallthepies	robben is only 30
2014-06-16 12:52:52	[Persia]bortion	like in baseball/cycling/track and field
2014-06-16 12:52:57	Vaanir	Uh yeah 
2014-06-16 12:52:58	whoateallthepies	he's not ridiculously old
2014-06-16 12:53:02	whoateallthepies	he just looks it
2014-06-16 12:53:04	rchase	there's not a player on the field that's not on something... face it.
2014-06-16 12:53:05	flobin	I haven heard of them catching anyone recently
2014-06-16 12:53:07	[Persia]bortion	yeah sun damage
2014-06-16 12:53:09	Vaanir	Only after a few years though Abortion
2014-06-16 12:53:12	[Persia]bortion	what who
2014-06-16 12:53:20	rchase	but more likely cocaine than dome fancy drug
2014-06-16 12:53:24	[Persia]bortion	lol rchase
2014-06-16 12:53:25	Hohoras	hey guys heres a fun fact: the sumerian Renaissance took place in 2050 BC
2014-06-16 12:53:28	Wardje	no cases come to mind, but I think that's mostly due to bad checking, can't imagine it doesn't exist at all here
2014-06-16 12:53:31	[Persia]bortion	a few tennis players were caught with cocaine
2014-06-16 12:53:31	Hohoras	thats hilarious
2014-06-16 12:53:32	whoateallthepies	and top sprinters usually peak near 30 in the olympics
2014-06-16 12:53:38	whoateallthepies	usain bolt excepted
2014-06-16 12:53:41	[Persia]bortion	my fave was french player richard gasquet who claimed he got his cocaine
2014-06-16 12:53:42	whoateallthepies	because he's a freak
2014-06-16 12:53:44	[Persia]bortion	from kissing a girl
2014-06-16 12:53:56	[Persia]bortion	when he's famously a closet case
2014-06-16 12:54:02	[Persia]bortion	Wardje the same is true in tennis
2014-06-16 12:54:05	[Persia]bortion	no prominent player caught
2014-06-16 12:54:07	◀▬▬	cbfc (8e3a7679@gateway/web/freenode/ip.142.58.118.121) has quit (Quit: Page closed)
2014-06-16 12:54:08	[Persia]bortion	but lotsa suspicions
2014-06-16 12:54:14	[Persia]bortion	and generally agreed that the dope checks are inadequate
2014-06-16 12:54:26	Wardje	[Persia]bortion: A big time doping doctor from cycling implied that he helped dope the spanish squad that won world cup. However that fell under patient confidentiality and by spanish law his records on it were destroyed
2014-06-16 12:54:30	rchase	so much money.  who cares if they're boosting?  don't kill the fatted calf, ya burk
2014-06-16 12:54:45	[Persia]bortion	whereas in figure skating there are dope checks but no one's ever been caught 'cause there's not much you can take to improve your figure skating
2014-06-16 12:54:56	[Persia]bortion	Wardje pfft
2014-06-16 12:54:56	Wardje	Ye seems less relevant there
2014-06-16 12:54:58	[Persia]bortion	people use that doc
2014-06-16 12:55:00	[Persia]bortion	to cover all spanish athletes
2014-06-16 12:55:03	GIF|Fred	"he's got 93 cats and he's experienced"
2014-06-16 12:55:03	[Persia]bortion	rafa nadal
2014-06-16 12:55:06	rchase	not true at all.
2014-06-16 12:55:06	[Persia]bortion	and everything else
2014-06-16 12:55:13	rchase	drugs are rampant in figure skating
2014-06-16 12:55:15	Wardje	[Persia]bortion: wouldnt be surprised if it's true though
2014-06-16 12:55:18	[Persia]bortion	if there's a successful spanish athlete that doc must've doped 'em
2014-06-16 12:55:24	[Persia]bortion	it's totally inconclusive though
2014-06-16 12:55:32	whoateallthepies	clearly you can be kind of out of shape and immobile and still be a top class footballer
2014-06-16 12:55:33	[Persia]bortion	lol rchase
2014-06-16 12:55:34	m625[POR]	Wardje, it's no surprised that as soon as that doctor was jailed barca's form dropped a ton
2014-06-16 12:55:44	[Persia]bortion	really m625[POR]
2014-06-16 12:55:45	m625[POR]	especially the older guys
2014-06-16 12:55:49	whoateallthepies	whereas cycling is all endurance/athleticism
2014-06-16 12:56:13	whoateallthepies	I imagine footballers would benefit from EPO/blood doping type stuff for recovery
2014-06-16 12:56:17	[Persia]bortion	although there are some forms of doping that could probably help in figure skating
2014-06-16 12:56:21	[Persia]bortion	it's just so much of it is artistry/finesse
2014-06-16 12:56:22	m625[POR]	yeah it was was pretty apparent the season before this one and then this season the older guys especially just were shadows of themselves
2014-06-16 12:56:24	rchase	yes there are
2014-06-16 12:56:28	m625[POR]	puyol and xavi especially
2014-06-16 12:56:29	FIFOd[a]	is it still 0-0?
2014-06-16 12:56:35	lone-m	doping or not. spanish passing is just pure talent. and that's their asset
2014-06-16 12:56:36	whoateallthepies	and if you're a robben/walcott type you might benefit from steroids
2014-06-16 12:56:36	Wardje	FIFOd[a]: yes, half time now
2014-06-16 12:56:41	[Persia]bortion	like singles skaters deliberately avoid bulking up their upper body

2014-06-16 12:56:56	[Persia]bortion	watching on BBC
2014-06-16 12:57:02	[Persia]bortion	yeah that's also inconclusive

2014-06-16 12:57:21	[Persia]bortion	oh duh
2014-06-16 12:57:22	m625[POR]	even more so that the goverment ordered the samples destryed
2014-06-16 12:57:25	whoateallthepies	well xavi and puyol started picking up injuries
2014-06-16 12:57:27	[Persia]bortion	#1 reason there's no doping in figure skating, there's no money in it

2014-06-16 12:57:49	flobin	they just have a dog running around the studio
2014-06-16 12:57:51	[Persia]bortion	the multi million sports probably have more likelihood of doping
2014-06-16 12:57:54	m625[POR]	the blood samples that were used in the case I mean
2014-06-16 12:57:55	[Persia]bortion	that's cute flobin

2014-06-16 12:58:22	[Persia]bortion	about what rchase
2014-06-16 12:58:23	lone-m	i can see it being "sensible" in sprinting. soccer requires much more though
2014-06-16 12:58:25	m625[POR]	whoateallthepies, but again that's all not evidence. it's just super fishy
2014-06-16 12:58:31	[Persia]bortion	lol rchase
2014-06-16 12:58:35	m625[POR]	especially the destruction of the samples
2014-06-16 12:58:43	rchase	even in high school they boost

2014-06-16 13:44:05	whoateallthepies	and asia is weirdly weak considering how many people actually live there
2014-06-16 13:44:17	whoateallthepies	I guess because the strong countries qualify in europe
2014-06-16 13:44:19	cyoz	there are so many teams that are not there but those two
2014-06-16 13:44:31	[USA]wiggly	yeah

2014-06-16 13:44:49	whoateallthepies	russia, turkey, kazakhstan should qualify in europe but I think they're uefa
2014-06-16 13:44:54	whoateallthepies	*asia
2014-06-16 13:44:54	rekkanoken	same thing for cricket in india.
2014-06-16 13:44:57	m625[POR]	whoateallthepies, japan is actually pretty good considering the lack of good teams there
2014-06-16 13:44:59	bruin	If they were smart, US and Mexico would understand the long term value of a confederation merger
2014-06-16 13:44:59	Wardje	russia is uefa
2014-06-16 13:45:05	Wardje	no?
2014-06-16 13:45:09	rekkanoken	isn't israel uefa as well?
2014-06-16 13:45:09	Wardje	ye
2014-06-16 13:45:09	m625[POR]	probably mostly because they have an ok league nationally
2014-06-16 13:45:11	whoateallthepies	right, but geographically they shouldn't be
2014-06-16 13:45:11	rekkanoken	might be wrong.
2014-06-16 13:45:13	lone-m	they somehow qualified for the world cup
2014-06-16 13:45:23	m625[POR]	yes isreal is ueafa because of political garabage
2014-06-16 13:45:24	rekkanoken	m625[POR]: china's league is almost as good as japan's.
2014-06-16 13:45:25	lone-m	i'm not sure how that's possible
2014-06-16 13:45:26	m625[POR]	too dangerous

2014-06-16 13:45:30	nom_nom	Nigeria why :(
2014-06-16 13:45:30	whoateallthepies	israel is uefa because all of the middle east countries refuse to play them
2014-06-16 13:45:38	m625[POR]	well turkey is in europe
2014-06-16 13:45:43	rekkanoken	i would say guangzhou > any of japan's teams.
2014-06-16 13:45:43	[USA]wiggly	probably for the best
2014-06-16 13:45:44	whoateallthepies	and probably if you're israeli away games are right out
2014-06-16 13:45:47	m625[POR]	israel on the other hand isn't
2014-06-16 13:45:50	Wardje	oh I misread your correction, whoateallthepies, my bad
2014-06-16 13:45:51	[USA]wiggly	turkey is not really europe
2014-06-16 13:45:52	[USA]wiggly	i mean
2014-06-16 13:45:56	[USA]wiggly	it depends on your definition
2014-06-16 13:46:00	bruin	US has 7 straight finals qualifications...it's pretty standard by now...Mexico has 15 or 16 appearances in the finals, including the last 6..they were banned from the 90 FInals..
2014-06-16 13:46:09	[USA]wiggly	a very small part of turkey is considered europe
2014-06-16 13:46:14	[USA]wiggly	most turkish people want to be considered europe
2014-06-16 13:46:23	cyoz	turkey wants to be part of europe for the money
2014-06-16 13:46:38	whoateallthepies	and their club teams are way too good for afc champions league
2014-06-16 13:46:42	cyoz	if asia was richer, nobody would talk about turkey being european
2014-06-16 13:46:42	Wardje	88th minute time, Iran going to score

2014-06-16 13:47:50	bruin	Turkey spans Europe and Asia...like Russia

2014-06-16 14:27:59	flobin	the only problem with Schiphol is that you can land super far away, where you have to taxi like 20 minutes
2014-06-16 14:28:09	[USA]wiggly	im gone about 1.5 weeks out of each month
2014-06-16 14:28:10	m625[POR]	My personal fav of recent times was SFO adding bart
2014-06-16 14:28:11	[USA]wiggly	for work
2014-06-16 14:28:19	m625[POR]	you can take bart straight into the airport

2014-06-16 14:29:04	flobin	m625[POR]: not that BART is so great
2014-06-16 14:29:21	m625[POR]	in terms of public transit that gets you straight into an airport it's the best I've seen
2014-06-16 14:29:40	flobin	yeah but otherwise it’s a disaster
2014-06-16 14:29:43	m625[POR]	and it's probably the best large scale metro I've used.

2014-06-16 14:33:24	limitz-ARSNL	what i hate about the world cup in the US... is that none of the pundits watch soccer on a weekly basis (looking at you Wilbon), but every world cup, they pretend that they're experts about the sport
2014-06-16 14:33:25	Wardje	draw doesn't necessarily mean a bad game (though last one obv was)
2014-06-16 14:33:26	limitz-ARSNL	and they're really not

2014-06-16 14:34:53	m625[POR]	and it's pathetic that someone who played is that completely stupid about the game

2014-06-17 11:04:01	Wardje	Sometimes the Belgian language reality makes me smile. Mertens is getting interviewed and the questions (and his answers) are alternatively Dutch and French

2014-06-17 11:05:07	kenperkins	Wardje: did you watch USA/GHA? did you think we looked as bad as I thought?
2014-06-17 11:05:12	Wardje	idk why they bother going live to some square to interview drunk fans, it literally adds nothing
2014-06-17 11:05:18	whoateallthepies	well modric had enough energy to be backup to alonso if he got in trouble, xavi can't do that
2014-06-17 11:05:32	Wardje	kenperkins: I only saw the summary, I was sleeping. USA didn't look that great, but were efficient in the attack
2014-06-17 11:05:47	Wardje	kenperkins: I think if Portugal shows up, then USA no chance (and against Germany definitely not)
2014-06-17 11:05:54	elios	i think they shot the first one in minute 1 ?
2014-06-17 11:05:54	kenperkins	We'll see

2014-06-17 11:06:02	whoateallthepies	USA were totally overrun and lucky that ghana's strikers sucked
2014-06-17 11:06:05	Wardje	or 33s, thereabouts

2014-06-17 11:06:14	whoateallthepies	really need a rethink against protugal
2014-06-17 11:06:19	kenperkins	you see Pepe's red was 4th straight WC with a RED for POR
2014-06-17 11:06:36	whoateallthepies	ghana had a lot of chances actually, ronaldo would've buried all of them
2014-06-17 11:06:43	Wardje	Pepe was truly dumb in that, think portugal will pick themselves together by next game though
2014-06-17 11:06:45	elios	haha
2014-06-17 11:06:57	Wardje	ye ghana has like 20 shots but only 1/4th tops on target
2014-06-17 11:07:09	elios	Wardje: sounds desperate
2014-06-17 11:07:21	Wardje	give that much freedom to Ronaldo or Nani and you're screwed
2014-06-17 11:07:21	kenperkins	I think worse for POR is the loss of Coentrão
2014-06-17 11:07:34	@m625[POR][BEL]	US looked terrible in that they did nothing.

2014-06-17 12:14:34	whoateallthepies	Mani_: it would've gone to diego costa if felipao weren't so stubborn
2014-06-17 12:14:44	whoateallthepies	they should've begged him
2014-06-17 12:14:48	@m625[POR][BRA]	that's a bit of a myth whoateallthepies 
2014-06-17 12:14:56	Biggz[BRA]	I remember back when I used to be in HS, 10, 9, 7 were the best players
2014-06-17 12:15:04	@m625[POR][BRA]	the spanish like to paint it that way
2014-06-17 12:15:11	limitz-ARSNL	imagine being diego costa... basically unable to step anywhere inside an entire country
2014-06-17 12:15:28	limitz-ARSNL	he cant even go back to brazil for vacation now without probably locals everywhere wanting to kill him
2014-06-17 12:15:29	@m625[POR][BRA]	there's even a prank call one of the spanish stations made to scolari
2014-06-17 12:15:36	@m625[POR][BRA]	and he totally wanted him to play
2014-06-17 12:15:42	@m625[POR][BRA]	said he was going to call him etc
2014-06-17 12:16:02	whoateallthepies	so your take is that it was all costa's fault?
2014-06-17 12:16:11	@m625[POR][BRA]	costa made his choice. but no one should say it's brazils fault
2014-06-17 12:16:12	@m625[POR][BRA]	no
2014-06-17 12:16:17	@m625[POR][BRA]	I'm sayin it was costa's choice

2014-06-17 12:16:36	@m625[POR][BRA]	people try to paint it like the brazilians didn't want him
2014-06-17 12:16:41	limitz-ARSNL	he picked portugal over brazil right?
2014-06-17 12:16:41	@m625[POR][BRA]	which is false
2014-06-17 12:16:43	@m625[POR][BRA]	no

2014-06-17 12:16:47	whoateallthepies	if felipe said to him that he would start for sure then costa would've come I think
2014-06-17 12:16:59	elios	france 98 ?
2014-06-17 12:17:03	bruin	Spain over Brasil

2014-06-18 09:24:06	LazyKenny	But they have their own rules for soccer and the way they play is screwing over player development during the most crucial years (18-22 years old)
2014-06-18 09:24:16	LazyKenny	Unlimited substitutions for one.
2014-06-18 09:24:17	[Koala]bortion	wow the dutch really did bribe the ref good

2014-06-18 09:24:52	@m625[POR]	quite a bit

2014-06-18 09:46:37	pifon	This is probably then cahill's last world cup match
2014-06-18 09:46:40	alecksi	it was only a yellow though?
2014-06-18 09:46:42	FIFOd[a]	dt3k: he's no pepe
2014-06-18 09:46:44	wac	only a yellow

2014-06-18 09:46:52	FIFOd[a]	over two matches
2014-06-18 09:46:54	FIFOd[a]	which is a dumb rule

2014-06-18 09:46:56	FIFOd[a]	it should be 3 matches
2014-06-18 09:46:56	forrmfhr	Hohoras: nouns/verbs changing depending on who you're talking about
2014-06-18 09:47:00	Biggz[NED]	Well, not to sound like a dick or anything, it was probably gona be his last match anyway
2014-06-18 09:47:04	Hohoras	no i know that
2014-06-18 09:47:07	whoateallthepies	I feel like I've seen a cahill-type goal before, but I've never see anything like van persie's goal in the spain game
2014-06-18 09:47:15	alecksi	yeah i know of that rule, but the foul wasn't bad enough that it wasn't a red card?
2014-06-18 09:47:24	wac	2nd yellow over two matches is fine. I don't want to see players get fouled out of the tournament during the first round.
2014-06-18 09:47:26	FIFOd[a]	I don't know my stream is lagging
2014-06-18 09:47:30	Hohoras	i just dont find words to say ontime
2014-06-18 09:47:35	FIFOd[a]	2 yellows over two matches is dumb
2014-06-18 09:47:43	Hohoras	halftime
2014-06-18 09:47:48	Biggz[NED]	Yeah I agree
2014-06-18 09:47:52	flobin	so the second half should be pretty different
2014-06-18 09:47:52	siba	word
2014-06-18 09:47:54	FIFOd[a]	2 yellows over two matches hurts defenders

2014-06-18 09:48:23	forrmfhr	flobin: tell yo team to bring your A game next half
2014-06-18 09:48:29	flobin	Depay for Martins Indi = attacker for a defender

2014-06-18 09:48:43	hooplah	time to EAT
2014-06-18 09:48:47	weaktea	not a bad half for the aussies
2014-06-18 09:48:48	FIFOd[a]	or even die, wac

2014-06-18 09:48:58	Wardje	flobin: let's see if netherlands can do something more in 2nd half then :o
2014-06-18 09:49:00	weaktea	by this logic, Australia > Spain
2014-06-18 09:49:09	forrmfhr	Hohoras: no way! are youethnically Kazkhak?
2014-06-18 09:49:15	flobin	arguably there will also be bigger gaps in the back
2014-06-18 09:49:29	Wardje	flobin: Cahill to steamroll the rest of the defenders!
2014-06-18 09:49:30	weaktea	or maybe NED isn't trying as hard because they aren't hungry for revenge
2014-06-18 09:49:35	forrmfhr	...do i need breakfast?

2014-06-18 09:50:17	flobin	why would you want a draw though
2014-06-18 09:50:21	Hohoras	and in pontus even earlier
2014-06-18 09:50:24	flobin	a win against Chile is by no means guaranteed

2014-06-18 09:50:30	weaktea	but dutch should be firs tin their group, and germany first in their, so they can go to the finals

2014-06-18 09:50:49	siba	or is it a win and a draw minimum

2014-06-18 09:51:08	hooplah	three draws would mean every game was a draw
2014-06-18 09:51:15	hooplah	so who would go through?

2014-06-18 09:53:21	Wardje	siba: then you'd have 3 teams with 2 points so it would depend on how much they got beat by the one that won all games, but yes that makes 2 draws possible
2014-06-18 09:53:21	siba	thats possible, righT? 
2014-06-18 09:53:27	siba	go through with 2 points

Of the players, the top two fakers were Abdul Kader Keïta, of Ivory Coast, and Cuauhtémoc Blanco, of Mexico; the third was Cristiano Ronaldo.

2014-06-18 20:29:39	[USA]wiggly	This is sometimes referred to as head orgasms, but this is about as sexual as saying eating chocolate is orgasmic (in that it's not sexual).
2014-06-18 20:29:40	[USA]wiggly	This physical phenomenon isn't experienced by everyone. If you've never had it before, you most likely won't feel it from the different triggers in this subreddit.

2014-06-20 11:02:24	Wardje	kikkit: media here all referred to spain group or italy group as group of death cause that's both 3 countries you would expect to get somewhere
2014-06-20 11:02:29	siba	usa and ghana arent challengers in my mind
2014-06-20 11:02:37	pape	nope
2014-06-20 11:02:39	Wardje	kikkit: group g everyone just assumed germany and portugal
2014-06-20 11:02:46	whoateallthepies	we'll see on sunday I guess
2014-06-20 11:02:57	siba	but the way this world cup is going
2014-06-20 11:02:58	Wardje	I'm not saying they were right or wrong in that assumption
2014-06-20 11:03:04	siba	probably gonna be usa ghana final
2014-06-20 11:03:06	whoateallthepies	no one said costa rica had a chance

2014-06-20 11:03:07	Mitzy	Should Spain defend their world cup title, they will bcome the first team to do so in the history of the world cup!
2014-06-20 11:03:08	siba	is that even possible
2014-06-20 11:03:09	Wardje	But that's just how it is. Group of death isn't calculated by FIFA ranks
2014-06-20 11:03:13	whoateallthepies	they're going to win this group
2014-06-20 11:03:27	Wardje	whoateallthepies: that's irrelevant to the discussion at hand though :/
2014-06-20 11:03:45	whoateallthepies	well the "usa and ghana aren't challengers" argument
2014-06-20 11:03:59	siba	you know what i mean dude
2014-06-20 11:04:09	dt3k	Well we can definitely mark Spains group off the group off death list arguement
2014-06-20 11:04:12	dt3k	:D:D:D:D
2014-06-20 11:04:17	siba	everyone has a chance. but youd expect germany and portugal to go through
2014-06-20 11:04:22	siba	anywayssss
2014-06-20 11:04:32	lone-m	it's when there are 3 good teams, and 1 team that is deemed to be without much chance
2014-06-20 11:04:48	Wardje	Eh, group of death doesn't really change into the tournament normally. Teams disappoint and others have a super run, it always happens, it's football
2014-06-20 11:04:58	dt3k	it changes

2014-06-20 11:07:20	dt3k	The thing, no one in the US really cares what the rest of the world thinks, so if we say its the group of death, it's the group of death for us.

2014-06-20 11:09:50	whoateallthepies	0-0 against portugal will do nicely

2014-06-20 11:10:38	whoateallthepies	yea, england +ramsey+bale would be really tasty
2014-06-20 11:10:48	IslaNublar	maybe some kind of parallel tournament, specifically for non-official teams
2014-06-20 11:11:09	IslaNublar	team catalunya, team UK, Iberia all stars

2014-06-20 11:13:51	whoateallthepies	without pepe and coentrao that portugal back line looks severely weakened

2014-06-20 11:16:35	Biggz	well, I dont think they would report lies
2014-06-20 11:16:48	kikkit	people were in other channels saying it
2014-06-20 11:16:53	kikkit	it was being said

2014-06-20 11:17:10	Wardje	kikkit: given that ghana-usa could've gone either way and everyone expected both ghana and usa to lose to Portugal and Germany, I don't see how saying "might not even win 1" is especially offensive
2014-06-20 11:17:17	Wardje	It's what most would call realism :|
2014-06-20 11:17:18	whoateallthepies	it's just a real stretch to say it's anti-gay

2014-06-20 11:24:04	kikkit	Wardje i say subjective as in like, spain gets 2 other good teams in their group but since they're world champs and (over)confident don't consider it a group of death because they're going to beat everyone up
2014-06-20 11:24:19	Abortion	I don't think spain was being overconfident
2014-06-20 11:24:20	Abortion	from what I saw

2014-06-20 11:25:10	Wardje	kikkit: that's just looking at the group of death incorrectly imo. Group of death is not a "this group is hard for me", it's about the possible elimination of someone you expect to go far
2014-06-20 11:25:44	kikkit	Abortion i'm more or less, or maybe not, being hypothetical to explain what i meant by subjective
2014-06-20 11:26:14	kikkit	Wardje so it would be dubbed by the media then, not the teams

2014-06-20 11:27:39	Wardje	kikkit: Nobody expects (expected?) USA to go especially far in the tournament, nor Ghana. So nobody considered it a group of death

2014-06-21 07:33:57	wiggly	because 200 is " normal"
2014-06-21 07:34:01	wiggly	and im jus like

2014-06-21 07:34:15	Wardje	how do you measure your bf, wiggly? I only ever tried it with some usa military site that made you measure body parts
2014-06-21 07:34:18	Vaanir	200lb is normal for Chris Hemsworth who is drugged up to the max and is 6ft 2 :p
2014-06-21 07:34:27	wiggly	exactly Vaanir 
2014-06-21 07:34:32	wiggly	i think he is taller than 6'2 though
2014-06-21 07:34:37	wiggly	pretty sure he is like 6'5 or 4
2014-06-21 07:34:46	@m625[POR]	fat callipers work well
2014-06-21 07:34:49	Vaanir	Around 6ft 3 or so i think

2014-06-21 07:35:00	wiggly	yeah 6'3
2014-06-21 07:35:10	Vaanir	He has to eat like 4k calories to maintain that weight tho

2014-06-21 07:35:18	wiggly	it is all muscle
2014-06-21 07:35:26	wiggly	so for a 300 lbs guy to think that that is a normal weight
2014-06-21 07:35:30	Vaanir	Those casual drugs tho
2014-06-21 07:35:30	wiggly	no
2014-06-21 07:35:36	Vaanir	He isn't natural
2014-06-21 07:35:37	wiggly	you gonna be overweight at 200 still

2014-06-21 09:26:02	Wardje	formfhr: people been using that argument to try and dispel every sane analysis. Any realistic expectation expects argentina to win. Sure something else can happen, that doesn't make the realistic expectation less realistic though
2014-06-21 09:26:24	Wardje	Strange things have happened, therefor your rational look at things can be ignored is just a lame argument
2014-06-21 09:26:39	formfhr	Wardje: i'm not saying iran's going to win and arguing for it seriously. i'm kind of kidding you know.
2014-06-21 09:27:08	formfhr	Wardje: but i do want them to score a goal or park the bus or something because their fans have come a long way and just to make their people proud for at least a moment
2014-06-21 09:27:10	drappy	I am going for Argentina because they have two of my favourite plays, Which might be to your surprise is not Messi
2014-06-21 09:27:17	Wardje	formfhr: ok, people just been using that argument for like a week now and it's getting silly

2014-06-21 09:28:18	drappy	I think CR7 is better than Messi and i hate CR7
2014-06-21 09:28:18	formfhr	Wardje: i do like watching spain and portugal crumble, but it's always done by bigger teams. iran hasn't got the power to stave off an arg goal, but i do wish, in a perfect world, that iran could do its country proud
2014-06-21 09:28:40	Biggz[ARG]	remember messi from way back when he used to play for FC Barcelona with Ronaldinho
2014-06-21 09:29:05	formfhr	fuck the messi train. and fuck barcelona. that's speaking as an embittered united fan.
2014-06-21 09:29:08	Wardje	Making it to the world cup seems like a good achievement in and off itself tbh
2014-06-21 09:29:38	formfhr	sure but people did come from IRAN to see it. they deserve a goal.
2014-06-21 09:29:38	Wardje	then again, I guess Iran's conference is pretty useless too
2014-06-21 09:29:42	drappy	formfhr, are you from Manchester?
2014-06-21 09:29:54	formfhr	and the fact that they haven't conceded a goal yet is pretty nice.

2014-06-21 10:33:35	HohoPersia	300 takes place 1000 years earlier
2014-06-21 10:33:56	formfhr	i don't get that from him. but i do think he spends way too long on his hair
2014-06-21 10:33:58	Vaanir	Lavezzi on

2014-06-21 10:34:08	HohoPersia	they didnt fight too well in 630 ad
2014-06-21 10:34:14	HohoPersia	dont confuse
2014-06-21 10:34:14	Wardje	Except that the movie is a pretty lousy representation iirc
2014-06-21 10:34:18	nom_nom	^
2014-06-21 10:34:26	FIFOd	Wardje, you meant he movie wasn't historically accurate?
2014-06-21 10:34:29	Unlix	movie was greaet
2014-06-21 10:34:29	FIFOd	no way
2014-06-21 10:34:37	formfhr	and the sequel 300 is even worse historically speaking
2014-06-21 10:34:45	HohoPersia	you people are talking about 500 bc, im talking about 600 AD
2014-06-21 10:34:48	Wardje	That's like saying you know how good america was in vietnam through the Rambo movies
2014-06-21 10:34:48	formfhr	but what do you expect from frank miller?
2014-06-21 10:34:48	FIFOd	HohoPersia, I'm talking about 2014
2014-06-21 10:34:52	Joe42	formfhr: her just reminds me of  the jocks from high school that were only capable of thinking about girls and sports, but they usually grew out of that.
2014-06-21 10:35:00	Unlix	actually i think the sequel made some things better
2014-06-21 10:35:16	Joe42	Yeah, but the sequel had Eva Green so..
2014-06-21 10:35:26	formfhr	Joe42: yes! i can absolutely see that. but to be fair, most footballers are all about chicks when they're not thinking about soccer =]
2014-06-21 10:35:31	Unlix	like calling out the spartians on wasting 300 men when they could have joined with the united greek army instead
2014-06-21 10:35:40	FIFOd	formfhr, what else is there to think about?
2014-06-21 10:35:47	FIFOd	formfhr, soccer and women...

2014-06-23 17:33:19	Drappy[BRA]	FIFOd and raphaelsc the reason Fenômeno is so good is because he had the talent plus the mental ability to make his opponents always second guess him.

2014-06-23 18:19:13	raphaelsc	It's basically that a full-blown OS like Linux isn't a good choice for virtual machines, they tried to solve problems through containers.

2014-06-23 18:30:31	raphaelsc	The good thing about being an open source developer is that you work with the best hackers out there.
2014-06-23 18:31:06	raphaelsc	You learn a lot, and increase the quality of your work as your code is severely reviewed before getting accepted into the codebase.

2014-06-24 10:44:34	@m625[PORTUGAL]	first match set on thurs is group g
2014-06-24 10:44:37	Wardje	Think the teeth was more accidental. Think he tried for the headbutt
2014-06-24 10:44:38	Myakyu	Wardje: i'm nice!
2014-06-24 10:44:46	jim_duggan[USA]	The Ghana/Portugal game should be great.  Both are playing for their lives
2014-06-24 10:44:48	Joe42	ragnob: Just kick the shit out of Portugal and we lose.
2014-06-24 10:44:55	Biggz[BRA]	At this point, it doesn't really matter if he did or not, Joe42. The fact of the matter is Suarez had intentions and clearly instigated

2014-06-24 10:45:12	Myakyu	jim_duggan[USA]: fingers crossed for a draw
2014-06-24 10:45:15	alecksi	fucccckkkk
2014-06-24 10:45:20	alecksi	that was purdy
2014-06-24 10:45:20	ragnob	so will he only get banned for the tournament then?
2014-06-24 10:45:22	ragnob	if they do that
2014-06-24 10:45:23	Wardje	Would need to be a pretty big victory for Portugal to go through though (or Germany would need to steamroll USA)
2014-06-24 10:45:23	Rachel-MGoBlue	SOMEBODY SHOOT
2014-06-24 10:45:27	jim_duggan[USA]	Myakyu:  definitly
2014-06-24 10:45:31	ragnob	germany needs 5 right?
2014-06-24 10:45:35	Wardje	or a little bit of both
2014-06-24 10:45:39	Volkard	suarez had bitten someone?!
2014-06-24 10:45:42	ragnob	cant we just play for a draw.
2014-06-24 10:45:45	@m625[PORTUGAL]	germany needs/wants the win
2014-06-24 10:45:47	ragnob	:(

2014-06-24 10:45:52	@m625[PORTUGAL]	they do not want to be second
2014-06-24 10:45:59	FIFOd[a]	If I'm defender who got bitten by Suarez, I end his world cup if Italy isn't winning in the last minute of stoppage time
2014-06-24 10:46:05	Joe42	Volkard: We don't know. 
2014-06-24 10:46:08	ragnob	I mean they'd beat Belgium easily i think
2014-06-24 10:46:09	Wardje	a tie also puts germany in first spot though
2014-06-24 10:46:11	Biggz[BRA]	Yes Volkard. At least that's what it looked like
2014-06-24 10:46:17	[GER]ToX_	germany would be first with a draw too
2014-06-24 10:46:18	Volkard	any gif?
2014-06-24 10:46:21	@m625[PORTUGAL]	Wardje, but they're not going to risk playing for a tie

2014-06-24 10:46:34	Larry13	Volkard: if he didn't bite him he was sucking his shoulder.
2014-06-24 10:46:37	alecksi	germany wants them goals tho
2014-06-24 10:46:40	@m625[PORTUGAL]	that's not how germany plays
2014-06-24 10:46:47	Wardje	m625[PORTUGAL]: definitely agree with that. I don't see that german team ever not caring about winning
2014-06-24 10:46:53	jim_duggan[USA]	m625[PORTUGAL]:  You wanna talk about magic goals out of nowhere...
2014-06-24 10:46:57	larina	i hope germany wins like 8-0
2014-06-24 10:46:58	Joe42	that looks like a bite man

2014-06-24 11:21:23	Wardje	in a world cup it was needed to decide between netherlands and ireland once, who got spot 2 and who got spot 3
2014-06-24 11:21:33	Wardje	both of those spots still meant going through though at the time
2014-06-24 11:21:37	pape	jim_duggan[USA]: do you live near orlando?
2014-06-24 11:21:39	pape	http://orlandocitysc.com/home/
2014-06-24 11:21:43	Wardje	ireland got 2nd, netherlands got 3rd

2014-06-24 11:22:43	Biggz[BRA]	You would think with such a vast hispanic/caribbean culture, that they would have  ateam
2014-06-24 11:22:58	pape	they have had one off and on, but not in the top flight for a while
2014-06-24 11:23:03	Rachel-MGoBlue	beckham is trying to get them one i thought
2014-06-24 11:23:05	pape	yes
2014-06-24 11:23:06	Caffrey	If that doesn't get him a 5 match ban or more, fuck FIFA
2014-06-24 11:23:27	drappina	So I think his international career(Suarez)

2014-06-24 11:24:10	Myakyu	yah i don't think it'll be that severe
2014-06-24 11:24:22	Myakyu	but like... then again, it's not his first time
2014-06-24 11:24:30	Myakyu	or second
2014-06-24 11:24:32	Rachel-MGoBlue	at the very least, this world cup has to be done for him
2014-06-24 11:24:32	drappina	Well this is two world cups in a row he has done something stupid. 
2014-06-24 11:24:52	Myakyu	and he said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again barely more than a year ago
2014-06-24 11:25:04	drappina	He is making the game look bad. 
2014-06-24 11:25:38	drappina	I never have forgiven him about what he did to Ghana 
2014-06-24 11:26:08	SuarezsDentist_	drappina: that was a perfectly legal play
2014-06-24 11:26:17	pape	south american cultures see his behaviour as positive 
2014-06-24 11:26:26	Harry[GER]	same here drappina

2014-06-24 17:01:02	drappina	What about the Mexican league? 
2014-06-24 17:01:11	pape	arguably allvenskan, liga mx and primera
2014-06-24 17:01:36	drappina	Mexican league is the best out of all of South America. 
2014-06-24 17:01:46	drappina	North 
2014-06-24 17:01:51	pape	i'd argue serie a is better than liga mx
2014-06-24 17:01:59	pape	on a per-team basis
2014-06-24 17:02:33	pape	there's high churn and payroll problems with mid to low table sides in liga mx
2014-06-24 17:03:09	pape	but yeah clearly liga mx is the best of concacaf
2014-06-24 17:03:43	pape	mls would be able to win the concacaf champions league if they were better than liga mx
2014-06-24 17:04:10	drappina	What about Asian leagues? 
2014-06-24 17:04:17	pape	i haven't followed any of them
2014-06-24 17:05:17	pape	i can only compare things like when santos laguna or morelia get to the fifa club world cup and play asian teams in a playoff round and dust them off pretty hard i have to assume that MLS would do alright against those entrants

2014-06-26 11:19:06	EZ[USA]	Athletes now are such physically beasts though
2014-06-26 11:19:07	dt3k[USA]CR7	I'm not saying Fed isn't all around better, but both in their prime at Wimbledon, Sampras wins.
2014-06-26 11:19:08	USAbortion	if nadal somehow ties fed in slam count
2014-06-26 11:19:11	USAbortion	I'll call nadal goat
2014-06-26 11:19:15	USAbortion	since nadal tromps fed in h2h
2014-06-26 11:19:16	USAbortion	yeah EZ[USA]
2014-06-26 11:19:18	USAbortion	it's amazing
2014-06-26 11:19:35	larina	yea it just depends on the conditions dt3k[USA]CR7 
2014-06-26 11:19:35	USAbortion	lebron james is the most impressive athlete physically Iv'e ever seen
2014-06-26 11:19:41	USAbortion	federer is amazing in a different way
2014-06-26 11:19:46	USAbortion	fed's movement just seems perfect
2014-06-26 11:19:50	USAbortion	he moves just enough to hit the hardest winner
2014-06-26 11:19:50	EZ[USA]	true true
2014-06-26 11:19:51	larina	thats why slam count is stupid .. cuz the conditions now are way loser together then they were in the 80s and 90s
2014-06-26 11:19:57	USAbortion	it's like choreographed
2014-06-26 11:20:09	USAbortion	changing rules doesn't change that only one person can win a slam larina
2014-06-26 11:20:24	dt3k[USA]CR7	Lebron can't carry a team like MJ could tho.  MJ had Pippen, Lebron has Wade/Bosh and still loses.  Replace Lebron with MJ, Heat win.  There is a reason MJ went 6-0 in the finals.
2014-06-26 11:20:26	USAbortion	there are  4 slams a year
2014-06-26 11:20:31	larina	huh?
2014-06-26 11:20:33	larina	i just mean it reduces the variance
2014-06-26 11:20:34	USAbortion	if sampras won less it's his fault
2014-06-26 11:20:40	larina	no its not

2014-06-26 11:20:50	USAbortion	and had all them baby mamas
2014-06-26 11:20:54	larina	fed would not have the semi streak in the 90s
2014-06-26 11:20:55	USAbortion	lebron is a nice family man

2014-06-26 11:21:15	EZ[USA]	I agree with MJ would have won these finals. I can't stand him or Lebron, I'd pick Kobe if I had to
2014-06-26 11:21:18	dt3k[USA]CR7	Lebron is an egomaniac

2014-06-26 11:43:41	kikkit	If more "Americans" are watching soccer today, it's only because of the demographic switch effected by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 immigration law. I promise you: No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer. One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time.

2014-06-26 14:43:36	[USA]wiggly	this is why people try to maximise their satiety factor by picking food foods with lots of fiber
2014-06-26 14:43:41	rekkanoken	or just the ball, i don't remember.

If anything USA has looked like one of the more fit sides in the tournament.

2014-06-26 17:41:25	dt3k[Murica]	WON THE GROUP in 2010 AND ENGLAND WAS IN OUR GROUP, GOT FURTHER THAN ENGLAND IN A HARDER GROUP IN 2014.  Actually won a match.  NICE PREMIER LEAGUE GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2014-06-26 17:41:40	kikkit	uh
2014-06-26 17:41:49	Volkard	like a retriement league for the most part.
2014-06-26 17:41:54	pape	less and less
2014-06-26 17:42:10	kikkit	big names sell tickets
2014-06-26 17:42:14	Volkard	sure.
2014-06-26 17:42:19	pape	it's just the financial structure that makes it weird
2014-06-26 17:42:25	kikkit	more money = afford better players
2014-06-26 17:42:31	Volkard	names sell tickets in europe
2014-06-26 17:42:34	Volkard	but the competition is just higher
2014-06-26 17:42:41	pape	they have highly constrained financial fair play laws
2014-06-26 17:42:42	Volkard	and theres demand for wins
2014-06-26 17:42:54	Volkard	like caps on budgets?
2014-06-26 17:42:57	pape	yeah
2014-06-26 17:43:01	Volkard	whats the cap?
2014-06-26 17:43:31	pape	not sure what the exact cap is because it's not transparent
2014-06-26 17:43:43	Volkard	is it on par with european clubs?
2014-06-26 17:44:05	pape	but for instance when seattle signed dempsey from tottenham, the total value of the transfer and salary ($7m) was equivalent to the payroll of 15 other mls clubs
2014-06-26 17:44:08	Volkard	like can they buy someone for 60 million dollar?
2014-06-26 17:44:28	pape	yeah but they can only buy three players for an unlimited amount
2014-06-26 17:44:31	dt3k[Murica]	Spain OUT, England OUT, Italy OUT, Portugal OUT, Croatia OUT, Russia OUT, UEFA SO STRONG BROS.
2014-06-26 17:44:32	kikkit	how many teams in epl can buy someone for 60m
2014-06-26 17:44:37	kikkit	how many teams in la liga could
2014-06-26 17:44:37	pape	the rest of the players have to fit under some budget
2014-06-26 17:44:37	kikkit	2?
2014-06-26 17:44:44	Volkard	maybe 3-4
2014-06-26 17:44:52	Volkard	in la liga
2014-06-26 17:44:56	kikkit	dt3k[Murica] ok we get it thx
2014-06-26 17:44:57	snacilep	uefa would be winning in europe
2014-06-26 17:44:57	Volkard	in epl more
2014-06-26 17:45:05	drappina	Alot of teams have 60m they just don't spend it. 
2014-06-26 17:45:11	dt3k[Murica]	kikkit: good, you're going to keep getting it for 4 more years.
2014-06-26 17:45:15	snacilep	concacaf and conmebol have the advantage in SA
2014-06-26 17:45:16	drappina	Newcastle, qpr are just two. 
2014-06-26 17:45:29	pape	average mls player salary is $130k
2014-06-26 17:45:38	pape	per annu
2014-06-26 17:45:39	Volkard	who is the most expensive player in the US?
2014-06-26 17:45:44	Volkard	MLS
2014-06-26 17:45:50	kikkit	mls salaries are public
2014-06-26 17:45:53	dt3k[Murica]	MLB has the same problems with Salary cops, the Yankees dominated the 90s because they just had sooooooooo much more money than every other team.  Things have gottan a bit better tho.
2014-06-26 17:45:57	Volkard	I mean their playing card kikkit 
2014-06-26 17:46:03	dt3k[Murica]	cops == caps*
2014-06-26 17:46:11	pape	either clint dempsey or michael bradley
2014-06-26 17:46:12	FIFOd	Volkard, all salary data is public, one second
2014-06-26 17:46:28	Volkard	FIFOd, not salaries but transfer fees
2014-06-26 17:46:28	dt3k[Murica]	it was Beckham until he retired lol
2014-06-26 17:46:37	FIFOd	http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/April%201,%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf
2014-06-26 17:46:38	dt3k[Murica]	There were guys on the Galaxy making 40,000 USD per year
2014-06-26 17:46:39	pape	jermaine defoe was also similar in price to those two
2014-06-26 17:46:46	FIFOd	Volkard, oh you mean transfer fees
2014-06-26 17:46:49	Volkard	yeah
2014-06-26 17:46:55	pape	oh
2014-06-26 17:46:59	FIFOd	dt3k[Murica], they are not really starters
2014-06-26 17:47:01	pape	transfer fees are typically quite low
2014-06-26 17:47:02	drappina	Over here with villa coming to play for Melbourne, it is counted as free loan cause new York City are paying for his wages 
2014-06-26 17:47:11	dt3k[Murica]	Michael Bradley has the top base salary in the MLS
2014-06-26 17:47:13	drappina	We have a cap 
2014-06-26 17:47:15	dt3k[Murica]	btw
2014-06-26 17:47:19	Volkard	what was thiery henry transfer fee?
2014-06-26 17:47:22	pape	FIFOd: yedlin got paid $34000 for his first year where he had 32 starts
2014-06-26 17:47:30	drappina	Every Aussie sport has a cap. 
2014-06-26 17:47:37	Volkard	probably pretty low
2014-06-26 17:47:41	dt3k[Murica]	yeah, Yedlin plays pro sports and makes far less money than I do, lol.
2014-06-26 17:47:56	pape	Volkard: yeah typically pretty low or non-existent
2014-06-26 17:48:00	FIFOd	dt3k[Murica], lol
2014-06-26 17:48:20	dt3k[Murica]	I think MLB is the only sport without a salary cap in the US.  NBA/NFL have very very strict salary caps/rules.
2014-06-26 17:48:41	Volkard	so theres age restrictions and stuff like that in the US
2014-06-26 17:48:45	Volkard	I think thats kinda raare
2014-06-26 17:48:54	FIFOd	dt3k[Murica], but it's crazy high in NFL/NBA
2014-06-26 17:48:58	dt3k[Murica]	There are only 11 players in the MLS who make over 1M USD a year.
2014-06-26 17:48:59	Volkard	I mean to become a professional athlete
2014-06-26 17:49:09	Volkard	you have to be 18?
2014-06-26 17:49:10	FIFOd	Volkard, in a lot of sports in the USA yes
2014-06-26 17:49:23	Volkard	FIFOd, all sports I guess?
2014-06-26 17:49:25	FIFOd	Volkard, NBA has weird rules to keep high school kids from entering NBA
2014-06-26 17:49:26	FIFOd	no
2014-06-26 17:49:28	FIFOd	it's per sport
2014-06-26 17:49:35	Volkard	ok
2014-06-26 17:49:44	larina	yea they want ncaa to cake
2014-06-26 17:49:48	FIFOd	NFL you can't enter at a young age you need 4 years in a college weight room + drugs
2014-06-26 17:49:53	FIFOd	:P
2014-06-26 17:49:57	larina	so they hope the kids go to school for a year
2014-06-26 17:50:00	Volkard	well in european soccer its fairly common for clubs to start buying and selling kids at early ages
2014-06-26 17:50:20	FIFOd	Yeah
2014-06-26 17:50:25	FIFOd	That's why we suck in the USA
2014-06-26 17:50:32	dt3k[Murica]	Volkard: 133 Million per team under the new CBA for NFL.  71.7 million for NBA, you gotta think, someone like Lebron will make 20m a year, and you still gotta pay 14-15 other guys.  The NFL has to pay 53 players per team.
2014-06-26 17:50:51	FIFOd	Soccer has been a sport for mainly privileged white kids.
2014-06-26 17:50:51	Volkard	but thats NBA
2014-06-26 17:51:17	FIFOd	When I was in middleschool/highschool and played competitive as a kid my parents would regularly required to fork out many thousands of dollars per year
2014-06-26 17:51:19	Volkard	133 mil is on par I think with salaries budgets that major european football clubs have.
2014-06-26 17:51:28	Volkard	but soccer isnt as big as NBA is in the US.
2014-06-26 17:51:31	dt3k[Murica]	Michael Jordan just became the first athlete ever to hit a net worth of 1 Billion USD a few weeks back.
2014-06-26 17:51:49	FIFOd	dt3k[Murica], supposedly the Hornets are worth that lol
2014-06-26 17:51:58	FIFOd	dt3k[Murica], they are basing it on the clippers price
2014-06-26 17:52:11	Volkard	dt3k[Murica], its from those shoes
2014-06-26 17:52:18	Volkard	his contracts with nike
2014-06-26 17:52:31	Volkard	and bunch of other sponsors
2014-06-26 17:52:37	dt3k[Murica]	Tiger Woods was on pace to hit 1 Billion but then he had to give like 350million to his wife :P
2014-06-26 17:52:49	FIFOd	Volkard, no its from his ownership in the Charlotte Hornets 
2014-06-26 17:53:03	FIFOd	Volkard, they are basing the number off the price the clippers got
2014-06-26 17:53:06	FIFOd	it's funny numbers
2014-06-26 17:53:20	Volkard	FIFOd, he made money on that investment?
2014-06-26 17:53:39	FIFOd	Volkard, nobody knows how much a sports team is worth until it is sold because of brand/etc
2014-06-26 17:54:00	FIFOd	Volkard, so it's an estimate based off the recent sale of the clippers with additions and mainly subtractions based off of different factors
2014-06-26 17:54:01	Volkard	sure but they can estimate
2014-06-26 17:54:03	FIFOd	I mean, he's rich
2014-06-26 17:54:08	dt3k[Murica]	In January we valued the Hornets at $410 million. But the Milwaukee Bucks sold for $550 million in May, and they are considered the least valuable team in the league because of their market and arena. Sports bankers say the Hornets care presently worth between $600 million and $625 million.
2014-06-26 17:54:10	Volkard	I still think its pennies compared to the money he is making from nike
2014-06-26 17:54:17	FIFOd	Volkard, no
2014-06-26 17:54:27	FIFOd	I mean, it's probably about half is networth
2014-06-26 17:54:29	dt3k[Murica]	Jordan upped his stake in the Hornets from 80 to 90% and it made him a Billionaire. 
2014-06-26 17:54:49	dt3k[Murica]	Steve Ballmer is now the richest owner in all of sports.
2014-06-26 17:54:58	Volkard	not true
2014-06-26 17:54:59	FIFOd	But it could be he's only worth 800m and not 1b
2014-06-26 17:55:03	FIFOd	no big deal
2014-06-26 17:55:06	FIFOd	Volkard, in America :P
2014-06-26 17:55:19	dt3k[Murica]	Ballmer is worth 20billion USD
2014-06-26 17:55:20	FIFOd	Volkard, UAE princes don't count because they can't audit their wealth :P
2014-06-26 17:55:34	dt3k[Murica]	Right, with an auditable net worth, Ballmer is the richest I believe.

2014-06-26 17:56:44	FIFOd	He has secret money
2014-06-26 17:57:35	dt3k[Murica]	The guy who owns the Mumbai Indians is pretty rich too, gotta be as rich as Ballmer

2014-06-26 17:59:55	dt3k[Murica]	I think the USA is the only country without publically traded teams.
2014-06-26 18:00:06	FIFOd	dt3k[Murica], most soccer teams are not traded
2014-06-26 18:00:17	FIFOd	dt3k[Murica], I have a list of a lot of them

That summer Haaland had surgery on his other knee because of old age/use that was completely unrelated to Keano. http://www.thejoycamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/themoreyouknow.png

2014-07-01 21:45:33	Wardje	one more what =o
2014-07-01 21:45:44	Wardje	o lol
2014-07-01 21:45:53	Wardje	well just got home, just wanted to say that really
2014-07-01 21:45:57	Wardje	time for bed now
2014-07-01 21:46:04	Wardje	almost 7:00, I'm pretty tired
2014-07-01 21:46:04	kikkit	:)
2014-07-01 21:46:19	kikkit	sounds like quite a celebration
2014-07-01 21:46:37	Wardje	I'm happy we actually properly dominated once (not counting the last 15 minutes of ET, those never happened)
2014-07-01 21:47:17	Wardje	The most awesome thing now would be to have a low countries derby semi final
2014-07-01 21:47:33	kikkit	i mean, one mans dominance is another mans lol wtf is wrong with them
2014-07-01 21:47:41	Wardje	gotta get past argentina for that though, so ye easier said than done
2014-07-01 21:48:06	Wardje	ye it was weird, USA seemed like nowhere near the team that played germany or portugal
2014-07-01 21:48:51	kikkit	but it was like... we can't seem to get the ball out of the top of the 18 and yet they can't seem to get it in the net
2014-07-01 21:49:50	kikkit	it gave us hope though
2014-07-01 21:50:16	kikkit	and though you guys dominated i still don't feel like we got trampled because we held you off for so long
2014-07-01 21:50:16	Wardje	ye the way we squandered chances was horrid too
2014-07-01 21:50:20	kikkit	so it was a good game
2014-07-01 21:50:51	Wardje	I think like halfway second half we had like 20 shots on goal and almost all useless ,_,
2014-07-01 21:51:16	kikkit	yeah tim howard broke some record for most saves or something
2014-07-01 21:51:17	Wardje	happy that lukaku got his goal, must be quite the relief for him
2014-07-01 21:51:41	kikkit	i just say tim let him have it since they were teammates ;)
2014-07-01 21:51:53	kikkit	he didnt want to be the star of the game then go down in pks
2014-07-01 21:52:38	Wardje	h
2014-07-01 21:52:50	Wardje	hehe that's one way to look at it ;)
2014-07-01 21:53:01	Wardje	anyway, gonna catch some sleep now
2014-07-01 21:53:05	kikkit	sleep well

2014-07-01 21:53:59	kikkit	and i may or may not have cried myself to sleep earlier
2014-07-01 21:54:48	 *	Wardje pats kikkit
2014-07-01 21:54:58	kikkit	:)
2014-07-01 21:55:05	Wardje	I'd say I wish it would've ended better for you, but I'd be lying
2014-07-01 21:55:33	kikkit	i'm not sad or disappointed, maybe a little sad
2014-07-01 21:55:41	Wardje	but ye, sleep! vroooom
