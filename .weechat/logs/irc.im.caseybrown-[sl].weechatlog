2014-04-07 11:15:53	jackhxs	do we have the haproxy qps data in ganglia?
2014-04-07 11:16:08	CaseyBrown-[sl]	we should
2014-04-07 11:17:10	CaseyBrown-[sl]	well, it looks like something is broken

2014-04-07 11:19:43	jackhxs	i dont see anything on the graphs
2014-04-07 11:19:58	CaseyBrown-[sl]	yeah, broken
2014-04-07 11:20:02	CaseyBrown-[sl]	i'll have a look
2014-04-07 14:50:42	jackhxs	any update on the graphs?
2014-04-07 14:51:59	CaseyBrown-[sl]	a number of things got messed up in the various haproxy changes
2014-04-07 14:52:08	CaseyBrown-[sl]	fixing them one at a time
2014-04-07 14:53:10	jackhxs	ok
2014-04-07 14:53:30	jackhxs	i double checked the td-agent.log, the extra logging is removed now

2014-04-14 14:42:25	jackhxs	what is the y-axis unit for the director.sl.ss graphs?
2014-04-14 14:43:14	jackhxs	number/second?
2014-04-14 14:43:58	CaseyBrown-[sl]	qps
2014-04-14 14:47:53	jackhxs	is that the total over a 15 second internal?
2014-04-14 14:47:58	jackhxs	or average
2014-04-14 14:48:08	CaseyBrown-[sl]	queries per second
2014-04-14 14:48:31	CaseyBrown-[sl]	it takes the count every 60s
2014-04-14 14:48:49	CaseyBrown-[sl]	then divides the delta from the previous count by 60
2014-04-14 14:50:29	jackhxs	well the ganglia interval is 15s it seems
2014-04-14 14:50:49	jackhxs	https://noc.slideshare.com/ganglia/graph.php?r=hour&z=xlarge&title=&vl=&x=&n=&hreg[]=director&mreg[]=rails_farm__%7Crails_canary_farm__%7Capi_backend__&gtype=stack&glegend=show&aggregate=1&embed=1&_=1397153398538&csv=1
2014-04-14 14:51:47	CaseyBrown-[sl]	ah
2014-04-14 14:51:56	CaseyBrown-[sl]	the granularity is 15s
2014-04-14 14:52:05	CaseyBrown-[sl]	in the rrd that stores the data
2014-04-14 16:05:21	jackhxs	im seeing a lot more log lines in haproxy.log than what is on the ganglia graphs
2014-04-14 16:05:21	--	[CaseyBrown-[sl]] is away: Away (Away)
2014-04-14 16:07:06	jackhxs	could we have duplicate lines in haproxy.log?
2014-04-14 16:21:48	CaseyBrown-[sl]	unlikely
2014-04-14 16:22:00	CaseyBrown-[sl]	probably some of the graphs don't work
2014-04-14 16:27:03	jackhxs	i see
2014-04-14 16:29:19	CaseyBrown-[sl]	if you can point out graphs without data that should have data
2014-04-14 16:29:23	CaseyBrown-[sl]	i can debug
2014-04-14 16:29:33	CaseyBrown-[sl]	(probably they just need to be deleted/recreated)

2014-04-14 16:40:57	jackhxs	so the 1xx's don't have data
2014-04-14 16:41:15	jackhxs	the other ones are working
2014-04-14 16:46:20	CaseyBrown-[sl]	well, there is a very low amount of data in 1xx
2014-04-14 16:46:28	CaseyBrown-[sl]	maybe 1 per day
2014-04-14 16:46:40	jackhxs	ya i thought that was the case
2014-04-14 16:47:19	jackhxs	do we have a graph for just the counts instead of qps?
2014-04-14 16:47:31	CaseyBrown-[sl]	total counts?
2014-04-14 16:47:33	CaseyBrown-[sl]	kind of
2014-04-14 16:47:49	jackhxs	ya, that would make it easier
2014-04-14 16:47:52	jackhxs	and more accurate
2014-04-14 16:48:10	jackhxs	cuz i just want a count of haproxy.log lines in a certain time period

2014-05-19 17:47:48	jackhxs	the haproxy metrics goes negative whenever it's restarted
2014-05-19 17:48:10	jackhxs	i think we need a check in the fluent plugin
2014-05-19 17:48:37	jackhxs	if the difference is negative, then do something
2014-05-19 17:48:49	CaseyBrown-[sl]	i kind of considered that ok, since restarts shouldn't happen that often
2014-05-19 17:48:56	CaseyBrown-[sl]	but i guess that assumption is different in ec2
