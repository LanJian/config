2014-04-03 11:55:25	LouisXu-[sl]	it takes too long

2014-04-08 12:42:41	LouisXu-[sl]	like the two missions i did were much shorter
2014-04-08 12:42:49	jackhxs	where are you now
2014-04-08 12:43:01	LouisXu-[sl]	back at dunwall tower
2014-04-08 12:43:16	LouisXu-[sl]	yesterday i abducted the royal physician
2014-04-08 12:43:29	jackhxs	i remember that
2014-04-08 12:43:40	jackhxs	the world and lore is really well done
2014-04-08 12:44:27	jackhxs	like the whaling industry, seven scriptures, and shit like that
2014-04-08 12:44:59	LouisXu-[sl]	yeah
2014-04-08 13:04:48	LouisXu-[sl]	i like the gadgets
2014-04-08 13:04:58	LouisXu-[sl]	and the overall environment
2014-04-08 13:05:07	LouisXu-[sl]	its enjoyable to be in
2014-04-08 13:07:59	LouisXu-[sl]	how far did you get
2014-04-08 13:10:11	jackhxs	i dont remember
2014-04-08 13:10:18	jackhxs	actually i do
2014-04-08 13:10:23	jackhxs	but it would be spoilers
2014-04-08 13:10:29	LouisXu-[sl]	oh true
2014-04-08 13:10:35	LouisXu-[sl]	but thats not the last mission right?
2014-04-08 13:10:41	LouisXu-[sl]	the dunwall tower one?
2014-04-08 13:10:45	jackhxs	no
2014-04-08 13:10:49	LouisXu-[sl]	dayum
2014-04-08 13:10:53	LouisXu-[sl]	i feel like shits about to get real
2014-04-08 13:11:02	LouisXu-[sl]	so do you know the entire story line?
2014-04-08 13:11:05	jackhxs	lol
2014-04-08 13:11:13	jackhxs	no
2014-04-08 13:11:21	jackhxs	never finished
2014-04-08 13:12:17	LouisXu-[sl]	but you got pretty far?
2014-04-08 13:15:47	jackhxs	ya
2014-04-08 13:17:39	LouisXu-[sl]	how come you got bored of it
2014-04-08 13:17:47	LouisXu-[sl]	i found the party level and the physician level so fun
2014-04-08 13:17:57	LouisXu-[sl]	so many ways to get the job done
2014-04-08 13:18:59	jackhxs	thats technically true
2014-04-08 13:19:10	jackhxs	but the game basically directs you toward being stealthy
2014-04-08 13:19:34	LouisXu-[sl]	i dont really use stealth
2014-04-08 13:19:41	LouisXu-[sl]	i just straight up fight everyone 
2014-04-08 13:19:44	LouisXu-[sl]	possible
2014-04-08 13:19:47	LouisXu-[sl]	cuz i like combat
2014-04-08 13:19:51	jackhxs	ya then the game becomes too easy lol
2014-04-08 13:19:55	LouisXu-[sl]	no
2014-04-08 13:20:00	LouisXu-[sl]	because the enemies are hard
2014-04-08 13:20:05	LouisXu-[sl]	they kill you fast
2014-04-08 13:20:26	LouisXu-[sl]	so the game becomes more about fighting than finding ways to stealth through
2014-04-08 13:21:08	LouisXu-[sl]	because you have to plan out how to fight them
2014-04-08 13:21:12	jackhxs	well i did stealth
2014-04-08 13:21:15	LouisXu-[sl]	or else you'll die too fast
2014-04-08 13:21:20	jackhxs	so i found it a little tedious
2014-04-08 13:21:28	LouisXu-[sl]	i had to use different combos of spells 
2014-04-08 13:21:32	LouisXu-[sl]	and weapons
2014-04-08 13:21:41	jackhxs	if you like this game
2014-04-08 13:21:49	jackhxs	you should play human revolution

2014-04-08 13:23:10	jackhxs	i just thought it has a better story and environements

2014-04-08 13:23:55	LouisXu-[sl]	i just like killing them in creative ways
2014-04-08 13:24:15	LouisXu-[sl]	i only go around on the roof tops and stuff to feel the freedom of the game's level
2014-04-08 13:24:49	jackhxs	well actually the levels didnt feel that open
2014-04-08 13:25:17	LouisXu-[sl]	really?

2014-04-09 10:51:54	LouisXu-[sl]	its fucking depressing
2014-04-09 10:52:06	LouisXu-[sl]	well not depressing but distressing
2014-04-09 10:52:18	jackhxs	i have never heard someone's mom asking him to buy her expensive shit
2014-04-09 10:52:38	LouisXu-[sl]	really?
2014-04-09 10:52:43	LouisXu-[sl]	i thought it was an asian parent thing
2014-04-09 10:52:50	LouisXu-[sl]	your mom never did that?
2014-04-09 10:53:12	jackhxs	no
2014-04-09 10:53:24	jackhxs	i dont know what kind of family dynamics you guys have lol
2014-04-09 10:53:33	LouisXu-[sl]	i dunno man
2014-04-09 10:53:46	LouisXu-[sl]	she just puts a lot of this family responsibility on me
2014-04-09 10:53:58	LouisXu-[sl]	expects me to carry my brother and shit
2014-04-09 10:56:22	jackhxs	lol its not an asian thing, sounds like a materialistic thing
2014-04-09 10:56:54	LouisXu-[sl]	well 
2014-04-09 10:56:59	LouisXu-[sl]	its probably not about the bag
2014-04-09 10:57:02	LouisXu-[sl]	but the gesture
2014-04-09 10:57:21	jackhxs	well yes
2014-04-09 10:57:22	LouisXu-[sl]	or maybe my parents are pissed cuz i never contact them
2014-04-09 10:57:30	jackhxs	as a gesture you should get your parents something
2014-04-09 10:57:43	jackhxs	just not a thousand dollar bags
2014-04-09 10:58:14	jackhxs	i mean you could if you want
2014-04-09 10:58:20	jackhxs	but the point is the gesture
2014-04-09 10:58:32	LouisXu-[sl]	so what should i do
2014-04-09 10:58:36	LouisXu-[sl]	but its complicated
2014-04-09 10:58:44	LouisXu-[sl]	cuz my brother already got her something so expensive
2014-04-09 10:58:51	LouisXu-[sl]	so if i get her anything less "valuable"
2014-04-09 10:59:00	LouisXu-[sl]	what would the gesture mean
2014-04-09 11:00:08	jackhxs	it doesn't matter
2014-04-09 11:00:21	jackhxs	if its actually about the gesture then it doesn't matter
2014-04-09 11:00:45	jackhxs	if shes upset you got her something less expensive, then its more about the materialism
2014-04-09 11:04:21	LouisXu-[sl]	btw
2014-04-09 11:04:25	LouisXu-[sl]	did you pay osap yet
2014-04-09 11:04:52	jackhxs	i didnt have it
2014-04-09 11:07:17	LouisXu-[sl]	oh ur parents just funded you?>
2014-04-09 11:08:13	jackhxs	ya
2014-04-09 11:45:45	LouisXu-[sl]	yo
2014-04-09 11:45:48	LouisXu-[sl]	what are you gonna hack
2014-04-09 11:45:52	LouisXu-[sl]	in the hackathon
2014-04-09 11:46:51	jackhxs	i dont know
2014-04-09 11:46:54	jackhxs	give me ideas
2014-04-09 11:47:12	LouisXu-[sl]	well
2014-04-09 11:47:15	LouisXu-[sl]	you might not like it
2014-04-09 11:47:16	LouisXu-[sl]	but
2014-04-09 11:47:26	LouisXu-[sl]	me and ritchie and them
2014-04-09 11:47:37	LouisXu-[sl]	we've been on the same facebook convo
2014-04-09 11:47:40	LouisXu-[sl]	for like more than a year
2014-04-09 11:47:54	LouisXu-[sl]	and basically its like a hangout were we gather to play games and talk about shit
2014-04-09 11:48:02	LouisXu-[sl]	i was thinking
2014-04-09 11:48:11	LouisXu-[sl]	if we got more ppl
2014-04-09 11:48:19	LouisXu-[sl]	then we can bascially have an online clan for anything
2014-04-09 11:48:26	LouisXu-[sl]	so
2014-04-09 11:48:29	LouisXu-[sl]	it be great
2014-04-09 11:48:34	LouisXu-[sl]	if we have a site
2014-04-09 11:48:51	LouisXu-[sl]	that aggregates lots of useful tools for such a clan
2014-04-09 11:48:55	LouisXu-[sl]	like voip
2014-04-09 11:49:06	LouisXu-[sl]	instant messaging
2014-04-09 11:49:15	LouisXu-[sl]	posts
2014-04-09 11:49:32	LouisXu-[sl]	content sharing
2014-04-09 11:49:33	LouisXu-[sl]	etc
2014-04-09 11:49:45	LouisXu-[sl]	its not very original
2014-04-09 11:50:11	LouisXu-[sl]	but if you can make it simple, nice-looking, and extensive
2014-04-09 11:50:17	LouisXu-[sl]	and template it out
2014-04-09 11:50:39	LouisXu-[sl]	its gonna can be the go to site template for any online clan
2014-04-09 11:51:03	LouisXu-[sl]	'nom im sayin'
2014-04-09 11:52:52	LouisXu-[sl]	like the modern, lean, new model for the old online community forums
2014-04-09 11:53:05	LouisXu-[sl]	back in the late 2000s
2014-04-09 11:53:22	LouisXu-[sl]	remember vbulletin and IPB
2014-04-09 11:56:03	jackhxs	i see

2014-04-24 13:03:47	jackhxs	at least the english version
2014-04-24 13:03:58	LouisXu-[sl]	the thing about free to play games is that their so grindy
2014-04-24 13:04:08	jackhxs	all mmo's are grindy
2014-04-24 13:04:11	LouisXu-[sl]	you kind of have to pay for convienence and such
2014-04-24 13:04:15	jackhxs	cant avoid it lol
2014-04-24 13:04:25	LouisXu-[sl]	im just gonna play wildstar
2014-04-24 13:04:31	LouisXu-[sl]	i like the combat
2014-04-24 13:04:34	LouisXu-[sl]	its pretty sick
2014-04-24 13:04:35	jackhxs	for mmo's i usually just play till like lvl 20
2014-04-24 13:04:38	LouisXu-[sl]	and the boss fights
2014-04-24 13:04:45	jackhxs	then i basically saw everything i need to see
2014-04-24 13:04:48	LouisXu-[sl]	same
2014-04-24 13:04:53	LouisXu-[sl]	but the new mmos
2014-04-24 13:04:59	LouisXu-[sl]	you need to be higher lvl
2014-04-24 13:05:06	LouisXu-[sl]	in order to get to the good content
2014-04-24 13:05:16	LouisXu-[sl]	like the better boss raids and such
2014-04-24 13:05:33	LouisXu-[sl]	i think im gonna get dark souls 2
2014-04-24 13:05:44	LouisXu-[sl]	because it looks cool
2014-04-24 13:05:49	LouisXu-[sl]	im just gonna dl it
2014-04-24 13:06:03	jackhxs	why not dark souls 1
2014-04-24 13:06:11	LouisXu-[sl]	i already played it
2014-04-24 13:07:23	jackhxs	o how
2014-04-24 13:07:30	jackhxs	you need a controller
2014-04-24 13:07:37	LouisXu-[sl]	i had a controller
2014-04-24 13:07:44	LouisXu-[sl]	in canada
2014-04-24 13:07:52	LouisXu-[sl]	but you could use mouse and keyboard
2014-04-24 13:07:53	LouisXu-[sl]	anyways
2014-04-24 13:08:10	LouisXu-[sl]	but the controls feels clunky either way
2014-04-24 13:08:22	LouisXu-[sl]	i liked the combat
2014-04-24 13:08:41	LouisXu-[sl]	like the animations, backstab and the different things you could do
2014-04-24 13:08:45	LouisXu-[sl]	but i hated the controls
2014-04-24 13:08:55	LouisXu-[sl]	not fluid enough
2014-04-24 13:09:01	jackhxs	controller is required
2014-04-24 13:09:03	LouisXu-[sl]	not like mobas

2014-04-24 13:11:03	jackhxs	with mouse keyboard
2014-04-24 13:11:09	LouisXu-[sl]	like pressing keyboard and mouse doesn't do anything at all?
2014-04-24 13:11:23	LouisXu-[sl]	or you just couldn't use some actions
2014-04-24 13:11:34	jackhxs	i cant open the first door
2014-04-24 13:11:49	jackhxs	it tells me to press A on the xbox controller
2014-04-24 13:11:56	jackhxs	i assume it maps to a keyboard key

2014-04-24 16:03:36	LouisXu-[sl]	but from the rest of the code
2014-04-24 16:03:49	LouisXu-[sl]	it seems like its just declaring i, j, linkOjb and coords
2014-04-24 16:04:05	LouisXu-[sl]	while setting linkCount = slideLinks.length
2014-04-24 16:05:00	jackhxs	that line makes no sense
2014-04-24 16:05:02	jackhxs	lol
2014-04-24 16:05:10	LouisXu-[sl]	yea
2014-04-24 16:05:18	jackhxs	ya its just assigning linkCount
2014-04-24 16:05:31	jackhxs	and evaluating the rest
2014-04-24 16:05:39	jackhxs	which doesnt do anything
2014-04-24 16:05:42	LouisXu-[sl]	yeah
2014-04-24 16:05:46	LouisXu-[sl]	it seems like just
2014-04-24 16:05:49	LouisXu-[sl]	var i
2014-04-24 16:05:50	LouisXu-[sl]	var j
2014-04-24 16:05:53	LouisXu-[sl]	var linkObj
2014-04-24 16:05:57	LouisXu-[sl]	in one line
2014-04-24 16:07:04	jackhxs	ya looks like thats what it does
2014-04-24 16:07:30	jackhxs	ok i see
2014-04-24 16:07:45	jackhxs	its not the comma operator
2014-04-24 16:08:01	jackhxs	x = a, b, c; and var x = a, b, c; are different
2014-04-24 16:08:12	jackhxs	the first one is comma operator
2014-04-24 16:08:25	jackhxs	the second one is multiple decleration
2014-04-24 16:08:27	LouisXu-[sl]	oh
2014-04-24 16:08:28	LouisXu-[sl]	true
2014-04-24 16:08:53	LouisXu-[sl]	but that still confusing
2014-04-24 16:08:54	LouisXu-[sl]	cuz
2014-04-24 16:09:01	LouisXu-[sl]	var x = a 
2014-04-24 16:09:09	LouisXu-[sl]	is assigning x to a
2014-04-24 16:09:26	LouisXu-[sl]	you would think the stuff after is also being assinged to x
2014-04-24 16:09:36	LouisXu-[sl]	when it has nothing to do with var x = a
2014-04-24 16:09:46	jackhxs	yep
2014-04-24 16:09:51	jackhxs	fuking javascript basically
2014-04-24 16:09:53	LouisXu-[sl]	var x, b ,c = c
2014-04-24 16:09:57	LouisXu-[sl]	or
2014-04-24 16:10:02	LouisXu-[sl]	var x, b, c = 1
2014-04-24 16:10:05	LouisXu-[sl]	makes sense
2014-04-24 16:10:19	LouisXu-[sl]	var x = 1, b ,c
2014-04-24 16:10:22	LouisXu-[sl]	makes no sense
2014-04-24 16:10:23	LouisXu-[sl]	LOL
2014-04-24 16:10:24	LouisXu-[sl]	wtf
2014-04-24 16:12:27	jackhxs	in ruby you would do x, y, z = 1, nil, 3
2014-04-24 16:12:40	LouisXu-[sl]	that makes so much more sense

2014-04-30 13:26:32	jackhxs	just gonna be another mmo probably
2014-04-30 13:26:44	LouisXu-[sl]	yo have u seen archeage
2014-04-30 13:26:52	LouisXu-[sl]	i saw some ppl playing it on stream
2014-04-30 13:27:07	jackhxs	no
2014-04-30 13:27:10	LouisXu-[sl]	the game play looks good and fluid but the graphics suck
2014-04-30 13:27:50	jackhxs	graphics looks pretty good to me lol
2014-04-30 13:27:57	LouisXu-[sl]	archeage?
2014-04-30 13:28:02	jackhxs	ya
2014-04-30 13:28:10	jackhxs	we talking about the same game? lol
2014-04-30 13:28:18	LouisXu-[sl]	its the one in alpha right now
2014-04-30 13:28:31	LouisXu-[sl]	did u look at concept art or gameplay?
2014-05-01 11:17:00	LouisXu-[sl]	also different shields have different parry/block frames
2014-05-01 11:18:29	jackhxs	ya thats the kind of game i wanna make
2014-05-01 11:18:33	jackhxs	in a wuxia setting
2014-05-01 11:18:39	LouisXu-[sl]	yeah
2014-05-01 11:18:41	jackhxs	cuz thats like the perfect setting
2014-05-01 11:18:57	LouisXu-[sl]	but wuxia requires even more deep combat
2014-05-01 11:19:07	LouisXu-[sl]	which is really really hard to make
2014-05-01 11:19:12	LouisXu-[sl]	even harder to balance
2014-05-01 11:20:39	LouisXu-[sl]	but the thing about dark souls combat 
2014-05-01 11:20:48	LouisXu-[sl]	is that its about spacing, timing and precision
2014-05-01 11:20:55	LouisXu-[sl]	its not exactly fast paced
2014-05-01 11:21:12	LouisXu-[sl]	in fact you get punished for trying to do too many things at once
2014-05-01 11:21:27	LouisXu-[sl]	i dont really think u want that for wuxia setting
2014-05-01 11:31:19	jackhxs	you can, it will just be a style of kung fu
2014-05-01 11:31:27	jackhxs	with calculated moves
2014-05-01 11:31:43	jackhxs	and another style might be all attacking, like a flurry of attacking moves
2014-05-01 11:32:10	LouisXu-[sl]	true
2014-05-01 11:32:34	LouisXu-[sl]	the spear and knife enemies in dark souls often flurry
2014-05-01 11:32:39	LouisXu-[sl]	its fucking annoying
2014-05-01 11:32:49	LouisXu-[sl]	cuz everytime i think its about to end
2014-05-01 11:32:52	LouisXu-[sl]	they strike again
2014-05-01 11:38:58	jackhxs	its like maxi from soul calibur then
2014-05-01 11:39:02	jackhxs	just keeps going lol
2014-05-01 11:39:10	LouisXu-[sl]	i dont know soul calibur
2014-05-01 11:39:12	LouisXu-[sl]	never played

2014-05-01 11:43:40	LouisXu-[sl]	these hunting tours are a bit pricey
2014-05-01 11:43:54	LouisXu-[sl]	but it doesn't seem like we need to already have license or experience
2014-05-01 11:45:20	jackhxs	wow 750
2014-05-01 11:45:29	LouisXu-[sl]	thats cheapest

2014-05-06 11:11:34	LouisXu-[sl]	i already asked chris

2014-05-06 11:12:07	LouisXu-[sl]	no
2014-05-06 11:12:11	LouisXu-[sl]	but he basically implied it
2014-05-06 11:12:30	LouisXu-[sl]	they're basically saying i need to stay in distro for a while or else it wont be worth
2014-05-06 11:12:41	LouisXu-[sl]	fuck man

2014-06-20 11:08:12	LouisXu-[sl]	yo if we want to pay less than 2000 each
2014-06-20 11:08:18	LouisXu-[sl]	i think we have to share a 1 bedroom
2014-06-20 11:11:36	LouisXu-[sl]	dude this one seems good
2014-06-20 11:11:37	LouisXu-[sl]	https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/4491346926.html

2014-06-20 11:11:48	LouisXu-[sl]	which is like the best internet possible here
2014-06-20 11:12:31	jackhxs	not worth i think
2014-06-20 11:14:08	LouisXu-[sl]	well all places prices are around the same
2014-06-20 11:14:18	LouisXu-[sl]	1 bedroom is like 3000
2014-06-20 11:14:23	LouisXu-[sl]	2 is like 4500
2014-06-20 11:14:40	LouisXu-[sl]	its just about location and amenities and how nice the place is
2014-06-20 11:15:09	LouisXu-[sl]	so we can either decide to go 1 bedroom and save a few hundred dollars a month
2014-06-20 11:15:30	LouisXu-[sl]	or go 2 bedrooms and live somewhat more comfortably with more expense
2014-06-20 11:45:36	jackhxs	ask joel to hook us up

2014-06-24 10:12:25	jackhxs	is it worth to go?
2014-06-24 10:12:27	jackhxs	i feel like no
2014-06-24 10:12:31	LouisXu-[sl]	same
2014-06-24 10:12:42	LouisXu-[sl]	although this price
2014-06-24 10:12:47	LouisXu-[sl]	is pretty tempting
2014-06-24 10:13:01	LouisXu-[sl]	it its slightly worse than the ones we saw on sunday
2014-06-24 10:13:07	LouisXu-[sl]	then we can take this
2014-06-24 10:13:13	LouisXu-[sl]	but i doubt it
2014-06-24 10:13:18	LouisXu-[sl]	its probably much worse
2014-06-24 10:13:54	LouisXu-[sl]	ask if she has any other days
2014-06-24 10:14:07	LouisXu-[sl]	or

2014-06-24 12:48:56	LouisXu-[sl]	everything pretty much

2014-06-24 12:50:59	LouisXu-[sl]	if I live in the suburbs
2014-06-24 12:53:22	jackhxs	well you can ask them what are the "events", and ask yourself whether you care about it or not
2014-06-24 12:53:59	jackhxs	i feel like i have very little in common with mark, loof, and stuart, so the things they care about the city i dont think applies to me

2014-06-24 13:37:07	LouisXu-[sl]	http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse
2014-06-24 15:13:40	jackhxs	o those ones
2014-06-24 15:13:45	jackhxs	too many buttons for me
2014-06-24 15:15:32	LouisXu-[sl]	i want them for mmo
2014-06-24 15:15:39	LouisXu-[sl]	hate using wierd ass keybinds
2014-06-24 15:15:47	LouisXu-[sl]	also good for the inventory of mobas
2014-06-24 15:15:48	jackhxs	ya
2014-06-24 15:15:52	jackhxs	i just dont mmo lol
2014-06-24 15:15:53	LouisXu-[sl]	instead of using 1-9
2014-06-24 15:15:57	jackhxs	true
2014-06-24 15:16:11	LouisXu-[sl]	man i played a few games of league again
2014-06-24 15:16:19	LouisXu-[sl]	its so much more fun when you're not autopiloting
2014-06-24 15:16:29	LouisXu-[sl]	and actually thinking about the game
2014-06-24 15:16:36	LouisXu-[sl]	and making active decisions
2014-06-24 15:16:51	LouisXu-[sl]	before I was just zombieing 
2014-06-24 15:17:02	LouisXu-[sl]	and never really knew y we won or lost
2014-06-24 15:18:00	jackhxs	ya, you should play dota
2014-06-24 15:18:12	jackhxs	league is more zombieing than dota
2014-06-24 15:18:14	jackhxs	i find
2014-06-24 15:18:46	LouisXu-[sl]	thats cuz u know dota in more depth
2014-06-24 15:18:56	LouisXu-[sl]	its the opposite for me
2014-06-24 15:19:35	LouisXu-[sl]	dota just takes too much effort in terms of practicing the mechanical stuff and learning the meta
2014-06-24 15:19:47	LouisXu-[sl]	for league i already have mechanics and know the meta well
2014-06-24 15:19:56	jackhxs	no but other ppl also say the skills in league are more generic, a lot of heroes you basically go QWER every fight
2014-06-24 15:20:03	jackhxs	and you just spam the skills
2014-06-24 15:20:12	LouisXu-[sl]	yea but thats just mechanics
2014-06-24 15:20:30	jackhxs	and they made the heroes so that every hero is viable in every situation most of the time
2014-06-24 15:20:33	LouisXu-[sl]	because league's mechanics are easier
2014-06-24 15:20:43	LouisXu-[sl]	you can focus on decision making and strategy more
2014-06-24 15:20:54	LouisXu-[sl]	which is y league is more accessible
2014-06-24 15:21:01	LouisXu-[sl]	no
2014-06-24 15:21:09	LouisXu-[sl]	the heroes in league aren't that balanced
2014-06-24 15:21:26	LouisXu-[sl]	a lot of heroes are really situational
2014-06-24 15:21:35	LouisXu-[sl]	but not as skewed as dota
2014-06-24 15:22:06	jackhxs	i know its not balanced, but from what i heard, most 1v1 situations, if you cant fight, you can always run away
2014-06-24 15:22:12	jackhxs	in dota thats not the case
2014-06-24 15:22:23	LouisXu-[sl]	well
2014-06-24 15:22:28	LouisXu-[sl]	someone has to win the 1v1
2014-06-24 15:22:30	jackhxs	theres hard supports that get destroyed by a fed carry no matter what
2014-06-24 15:22:51	LouisXu-[sl]	yeah thats the thing i hated about dota and hon
2014-06-24 15:23:05	LouisXu-[sl]	hard supports aren't fun to play but necessary
2014-06-24 15:23:18	jackhxs	ya but that gives more strategy
2014-06-24 15:23:27	jackhxs	cuz you gotta think about your team composition
2014-06-24 15:23:36	jackhxs	and think about how you are going to play the hero
2014-06-24 15:23:48	LouisXu-[sl]	thats true in every moba
2014-06-24 15:23:49	LouisXu-[sl]	lol
2014-06-24 15:23:53	jackhxs	cuz you cant just go out there, and run away when shit goes down
2014-06-24 15:25:19	LouisXu-[sl]	hard support is the result of the competitive meta exploiting flawed game design
2014-06-24 15:25:32	LouisXu-[sl]	you don't need it
2014-06-24 15:26:15	LouisXu-[sl]	its not appealing to always have one guy getting dunked no matter if team is winning or losing
2014-06-24 15:26:31	LouisXu-[sl]	it doesn't give the game more strategic depth 
2014-06-24 15:26:38	LouisXu-[sl]	it just makes the strategies different
2014-06-24 15:27:15	jackhxs	it does, cuz those heroes have skills that help your teammates
2014-06-24 15:28:10	jackhxs	thats what supports are, heroes with skills that cant really kill on its own, but will turn the tide of the battle when used to help your teammates
2014-06-24 15:30:29	jackhxs	like enigma's black hole, doesnt really do shit by itself, it just disables, you cant really kill with it
2014-06-24 15:30:45	jackhxs	but it helps your teammate to kill everyone that gets caught
2014-06-24 15:30:54	LouisXu-[sl]	yeah but y have that when you can have heroes that can do both depending on how you build and play
2014-06-24 15:31:10	LouisXu-[sl]	its limiting the player 
2014-06-24 15:31:26	jackhxs	but then every heroes just becomes more generic
2014-06-24 15:31:35	jackhxs	if i can build all the heroes however i want
2014-06-24 15:31:39	LouisXu-[sl]	but their skillset makes them unique
2014-06-24 15:31:40	jackhxs	why have different heroes
2014-06-24 15:32:05	LouisXu-[sl]	they play differently
2014-06-24 15:37:28	LouisXu-[sl]	w/e
2014-06-24 15:37:38	LouisXu-[sl]	anyways league is better for me
2014-06-24 15:37:49	LouisXu-[sl]	i played 300 hours of dota2
2014-06-24 15:37:55	LouisXu-[sl]	according to steam
2014-06-24 15:38:05	jackhxs	thats pretty good
2014-06-24 15:38:06	LouisXu-[sl]	so I've had a good sample of the game already
2014-06-24 15:38:11	jackhxs	now just play more with me
2014-06-24 15:38:15	LouisXu-[sl]	im not even just being biased

2014-06-25 10:17:04	LouisXu-[sl]	those are so ghetto
2014-06-25 10:17:31	jackhxs	how is it ghetto?
2014-06-25 10:18:00	jackhxs	you dont like curtains?
2014-06-25 10:18:28	jackhxs	what would you rather do?
2014-06-25 10:20:15	LouisXu-[sl]	like a slider
2014-06-25 10:20:39	LouisXu-[sl]	or a solid divider
2014-06-25 10:20:50	jackhxs	sure
2014-06-25 10:20:52	jackhxs	how?
2014-06-25 10:21:48	jackhxs	i know how to make that curtain wall, but i dont know how to build a slider
2014-06-25 10:22:03	jackhxs	unless you know, or you can find out, its kind of moot
2014-06-25 10:23:10	LouisXu-[sl]	i honestly dont care about divider
2014-06-25 10:23:17	LouisXu-[sl]	even if we get one bedroom 
2014-06-25 10:23:21	LouisXu-[sl]	im not gonna get divider
2014-06-25 10:23:27	LouisXu-[sl]	until i feel its really necessary
2014-06-25 10:23:51	jackhxs	lol you just went from, that curtain is so ghetto, to i dont want one
2014-06-25 10:24:04	LouisXu-[sl]	yeah i dont really want one
2014-06-25 10:24:14	LouisXu-[sl]	but im saying if I had to choose
2014-06-25 10:24:20	LouisXu-[sl]	i would rather want a solid one
2014-06-25 10:24:32	LouisXu-[sl]	but if i want a divider
2014-06-25 10:24:37	LouisXu-[sl]	i would get a tent instead
2014-06-25 10:25:07	jackhxs	there's also http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S79893417/
2014-06-25 10:25:16	jackhxs	but i dont know if any are in stock
2014-06-25 10:26:07	LouisXu-[sl]	yeah i rather have that
2014-06-25 10:29:33	jackhxs	ok
2014-06-25 10:29:57	jackhxs	i think a divider is good
2014-06-25 10:30:11	jackhxs	then i dont have to worry as much about disturbing you
2014-06-25 10:30:31	LouisXu-[sl]	ok
2014-06-25 10:30:32	jackhxs	but why do you want a solid one, as opposed to a curtain
2014-06-25 10:31:07	jackhxs	in terms of noise blocking, they are not gonna be much different
2014-06-25 10:31:28	LouisXu-[sl]	yeah theres no solution to noise in that situation
2014-06-25 10:33:25	jackhxs	ya, but i mean, i think even if you have a room, anything i do in the living room, you are gonna be able to hear anyways
2014-06-25 10:33:45	jackhxs	and i will hear you from my room too
2014-06-25 10:34:08	LouisXu-[sl]	true
2014-06-25 10:38:23	jackhxs	ya so why do you perfer solid divider
2014-06-25 10:39:52	LouisXu-[sl]	it looks better and feels more 'solid'
2014-06-25 10:39:59	LouisXu-[sl]	it feels more like a room
2014-06-25 10:40:06	LouisXu-[sl]	enclosed area
2014-06-25 10:40:16	LouisXu-[sl]	but curtains feels like hospital ward
2014-06-25 10:40:32	jackhxs	lol
2014-06-25 10:40:36	jackhxs	ok
2014-06-25 10:40:53	LouisXu-[sl]	btw
2014-06-25 10:40:59	LouisXu-[sl]	did u ask that adam guy
2014-06-25 10:41:01	jackhxs	well you can look into how to build a good divider
2014-06-25 10:41:02	LouisXu-[sl]	about 6 months
2014-06-25 10:41:37	LouisXu-[sl]	because
2014-06-25 10:41:42	LouisXu-[sl]	i dont mind getting a 2 bedroom
2014-06-25 10:41:58	LouisXu-[sl]	for <2.5k
2014-06-25 10:45:56	jackhxs	how to get a 2 bedroom for 2.5K?

2014-06-25 10:48:38	LouisXu-[sl]	true
2014-06-25 10:48:53	LouisXu-[sl]	but that place is nicer
2014-06-25 10:49:18	LouisXu-[sl]	fuck hard decision
2014-06-25 11:02:12	jackhxs	https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/4536025746.html
2014-06-25 11:03:12	LouisXu-[sl]	fucking security deposit is more than 3000
2014-06-25 11:03:34	LouisXu-[sl]	but the price is good
2014-06-25 11:03:35	LouisXu-[sl]	for the place
2014-06-25 11:03:40	LouisXu-[sl]	although the area is bad
2014-06-25 11:03:43	jackhxs	hmm no laundry
2014-06-25 11:04:02	LouisXu-[sl]	the area is almost worst than my area
2014-06-25 11:04:09	LouisXu-[sl]	i walked through there several times
2014-06-25 11:04:26	jackhxs	lol
2014-06-25 11:04:38	jackhxs	every area is bad according to you
2014-06-25 11:04:50	LouisXu-[sl]	no
2014-06-25 11:05:00	LouisXu-[sl]	i only say the civic center area
2014-06-25 11:05:04	LouisXu-[sl]	and the bluxome area is bad

2014-06-26 16:54:34	jackhxs	i dont understand
2014-06-26 16:55:02	LouisXu-[sl]	i mean i can't move in the time you move in
2014-06-26 16:55:08	jackhxs	how is telling your landlord you are moving related to checking out the place?
2014-06-26 16:55:39	LouisXu-[sl]	because i have to check out the place
2014-06-26 16:55:44	LouisXu-[sl]	before i decide to move there
2014-06-26 16:56:03	LouisXu-[sl]	but the earliest i can do that is july 5th
2014-06-26 16:57:18	jackhxs	uhh
2014-06-26 16:57:31	jackhxs	why dont you tell them you are moving out now
2014-06-26 16:57:37	jackhxs	then decide on a place later?
2014-06-26 16:57:55	jackhxs	lol im confused
2014-06-26 16:58:15	LouisXu-[sl]	because i have to leave in 30 days
2014-06-26 16:58:19	LouisXu-[sl]	and if i dont find a place in that time
2014-06-26 16:58:23	LouisXu-[sl]	i have no where to go
2014-06-26 16:58:54	jackhxs	yes
2014-06-26 16:59:14	jackhxs	thats how this works
2014-06-26 16:59:48	LouisXu-[sl]	so I should basically make sure i find a place within the time?
2014-06-26 17:00:32	jackhxs	yep
2014-06-26 17:04:43	jackhxs	did you just realize this now? lol
2014-06-26 17:04:53	LouisXu-[sl]	i didn't think it was a safe bet
2014-06-26 17:05:01	LouisXu-[sl]	i thought i would just find one
2014-06-26 17:05:05	LouisXu-[sl]	then tell them
2014-06-26 17:05:10	jackhxs	what was your plan if you didnt find a place by july 1st?
2014-06-26 17:05:17	LouisXu-[sl]	i had no plan
2014-06-26 17:05:18	LouisXu-[sl]	lol
2014-06-26 17:05:21	jackhxs	you didnt seem very urgent
2014-06-26 17:05:23	jackhxs	...
2014-06-26 17:05:27	jackhxs	........
2014-06-26 17:05:37	LouisXu-[sl]	i dunno dude
2014-06-26 17:05:43	LouisXu-[sl]	i just fucking wing it
2014-06-26 17:06:50	jackhxs	wow
2014-06-26 17:07:21	LouisXu-[sl]	i just wanted to go with a standard place
2014-06-26 17:07:40	LouisXu-[sl]	like use a standard build when playing a hero for the first time
2014-06-26 17:07:45	LouisXu-[sl]	little did I know
2014-06-26 17:08:01	LouisXu-[sl]	im no where close to being able to afford the standard place
2014-06-26 17:08:19	jackhxs	this is why you are living in a shitty place with no kitchen right now
2014-06-26 17:08:23	jackhxs	paying 1800
2014-06-26 17:08:26	jackhxs	you know that right
2014-06-26 17:08:50	LouisXu-[sl]	thats because i tried finding a place within 2 days
2014-06-26 17:09:09	LouisXu-[sl]	also that place is like one of the only studios < 2000 
2014-06-26 17:09:14	LouisXu-[sl]	around here
2014-06-26 17:11:39	jackhxs	well, we gotta take this shit seriously, if you wanna room together
2014-06-26 17:13:00	LouisXu-[sl]	well seeing as how we already have options
2014-06-26 17:13:17	LouisXu-[sl]	i guess we should be able ti find one within a month
2014-06-26 17:13:59	LouisXu-[sl]	fallback: netpass place, bayside village
2014-06-26 17:14:09	jackhxs	yep
2014-06-26 17:14:19	jackhxs	the chinese lady place is most likely gone
2014-06-26 17:14:23	LouisXu-[sl]	yea

2014-06-26 17:15:27	LouisXu-[sl]	and not as old
