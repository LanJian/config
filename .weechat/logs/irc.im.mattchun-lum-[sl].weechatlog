2014-03-31 13:34:46	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	I kind of want to buy this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16859107173
2014-03-31 13:36:12	jackhxs	what you gonna use it for
2014-03-31 13:36:26	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	set of home services, build cluster, etc.
2014-03-31 13:37:30	jackhxs	lol you can get microsoft server bundled with it
2014-03-31 13:38:10	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	lol
2014-03-31 13:38:16	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i'll pass on that part
2014-03-31 13:39:46	jackhxs	no hard drive though
2014-03-31 13:39:57	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah, that's fine
2014-03-31 13:40:10	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	compared to the cost of the thing, hard drives are cheap
2014-03-31 13:40:30	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	for some reason, newegg is selling for 2k cheaper than HP
2014-03-31 13:55:18	jackhxs	so how many machines will you have if you get this one
2014-03-31 13:55:44	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	9
2014-03-31 13:55:59	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	which is why it's unlikely i'll buy it
2014-03-31 13:56:21	jackhxs	you must have a spare one you can use then right?
2014-03-31 13:56:28	jackhxs	just not as powerful
2014-03-31 13:56:28	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	since i suppose i could re use one of the others
2014-03-31 13:56:32	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah
2014-03-31 13:56:37	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah, i know
2014-03-31 13:56:44	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	none of my machines comes close to this one
2014-03-31 13:56:59	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	like 48 gigs of ram, 12 cores, 24 threads
2014-03-31 17:26:46	jackhxs	emit transaction failed error_class=Fluent::BufferQueueLimitError error=#<Fluent::BufferQueueLimitError: queue size exceeds limit>

2014-04-01 14:18:46	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i don't know
2014-04-01 14:18:56	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	my other canadian coworkers had heard of it
2014-04-01 14:19:00	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	but they were older than you

2014-04-01 14:29:16	jackhxs	what did you set your weechat status bar to?
2014-04-01 14:30:58	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so i hid all the per-chat window ones
2014-04-01 14:31:04	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	and made a root status bar
2014-04-01 14:31:13	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	(it takes up less space)
2014-04-01 14:31:30	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	the trade-off is that i sometimes forget which window has focus
2014-04-01 14:31:36	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	even though it says on the status baar
2014-04-01 14:31:39	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	bar*
2014-04-01 14:32:35	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i used this as a starting point

2014-04-01 14:35:57	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah
2014-04-01 14:36:06	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	though his config executes the commands as they run
2014-04-01 14:36:16	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i just set everything up then saved my config with /save
2014-04-01 15:19:15	jackhxs	the source control info for my zsh prompt is kind of slow
2014-04-01 15:19:19	jackhxs	is is like that for you too?
2014-04-01 15:19:30	jackhxs	its like half second
2014-04-01 15:20:01	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	which source control things do you have enabled?
2014-04-01 15:20:03	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	just git?
2014-04-01 15:20:12	jackhxs	and svn
2014-04-01 15:20:34	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	and what are you noticing the slowness in?
2014-04-01 15:20:39	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	the svn one is slow as shit
2014-04-01 15:20:59	jackhxs	well both are slow
2014-04-01 15:21:04	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	oh
2014-04-01 15:21:07	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	hmmm

2014-04-01 15:21:32	jackhxs	ya
2014-04-01 15:21:39	jackhxs	or just pressing enter
2014-04-01 15:21:39	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	since speed is subjective, you could try it on mine

2014-04-18 10:40:49	--	irc: disconnected from server
2014-04-18 11:59:08	jackhxs	im making a gem, do we have any gem naming conventions i need to follow?
2014-04-18 11:59:32	jackhxs	i see several with ss_ prefix
2014-04-18 11:59:58	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	the ss_ prefix denotes some special slideshare aspect
2014-04-18 12:00:09	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	if it is more general, you can drop the prefix
2014-04-18 12:00:28	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i called our nagios gem ss_nagios because there already exists a gem with the name "nagios"
2014-04-18 12:00:33	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	(and it's shit)
2014-04-18 14:25:12	jackhxs	hmm gem install is taking forever with my gem
2014-04-18 14:25:17	jackhxs	is that expected?
2014-04-18 14:26:12	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	how are you installing it?
2014-04-18 14:26:27	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	how did you create the gem in the first place?
2014-04-18 14:26:48	jackhxs	gem build ss_response_code_export.gemspec
2014-04-18 14:27:07	jackhxs	sudo gem install ss_response_code_export-1.0.0.gem
2014-04-18 14:27:52	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so did you create the gem with bundle gem ss_response?
2014-04-18 14:45:05	jackhxs	no
2014-04-18 14:45:09	jackhxs	i didnt know about this lol
2014-04-18 14:45:27	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	because that would make a rakefile
2014-04-18 14:45:35	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so you could do rake install
2014-04-18 14:45:41	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	and that would build and install

2014-04-21 15:02:21	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i'm trying to remember what it was
2014-04-21 15:12:46	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i think you have to modify the chat area for a specific buffer

2014-04-22 12:35:17	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	it looks like there are a lot of required options
2014-04-22 12:35:32	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	it's probably the way it's being initialized
2014-04-22 12:35:36	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	let me check
2014-04-22 12:37:47	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i think because of the way it's parsed, you need to pass an empty array as the first param
2014-04-22 12:37:56	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	since options are parsed second
2014-04-22 12:38:06	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so new([], {options...}
2014-04-22 12:49:43	jackhxs	o
2014-04-22 12:49:44	jackhxs	ok
2014-04-22 12:50:33	jackhxs	worked thanks
2014-04-22 12:51:55	jackhxs	so we had "chicken yakitori" today
2014-04-22 12:52:02	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	lol
2014-04-22 12:52:05	jackhxs	which is chicken grilled chicken
2014-04-22 12:52:06	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	how was that?
2014-04-22 12:52:16	jackhxs	its pretty good
2014-04-22 12:53:16	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah, i thought i'd want to try it, but yeah, had to get my key today
2014-04-22 15:25:38	jackhxs	we should use this lol https://github.com/should-not/should_not
2014-04-22 15:27:24	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	lol
2014-04-22 15:27:45	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	I think we just need to make the rspec book required reading
2014-04-22 16:10:50	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	comcast sucks
2014-04-22 16:11:18	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	lost internet at my apartment, have relocated
2014-04-22 16:28:58	jackhxs	lol
2014-04-22 16:29:13	jackhxs	happened to me like twice
2014-04-22 16:29:24	jackhxs	but always came back in like 10 minutes
2014-04-22 16:29:48	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	it's happened relatively frequently
2014-04-22 16:29:53	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	usually at 2 AM or something
2014-04-22 16:30:13	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	actually, to be more specific, it's usually exactly when i need it
2014-04-22 16:30:19	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	that's when it dies

2014-04-24 15:54:26	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah
2014-04-24 15:54:44	jackhxs	theres also a gist gem
2014-04-24 15:54:56	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah, though i don't have that one aliased
2014-04-24 15:55:07	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i have pastebin -f - aliased to pb
2014-04-24 15:55:27	jackhxs	i see
2014-04-24 15:55:38	jackhxs	gist is short enough
2014-04-24 15:56:46	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i really need an alias for python -mjson.tool
2014-04-24 15:57:02	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	since i'm often dealing with shitty formatted json
2014-04-24 16:15:06	jackhxs	so useful, i used to paste it to some online json formatter lol
2014-04-24 16:15:25	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	lol
2014-04-24 16:16:11	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	it's pretty useful when using curl, since you just pipe to the json formatter
2014-04-24 16:17:00	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	I used to have a vim shortcut that curled to a given url and added the response to the current buffer
2014-04-24 16:17:14	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	for testing api stuff
2014-04-24 16:17:23	jackhxs	i havent actually learned how to use curl
2014-04-24 16:17:28	jackhxs	i just been using this chrome plugin
2014-04-24 16:17:36	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	the postman one?
2014-04-24 16:17:40	jackhxs	ya
2014-04-24 16:17:57	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah, that's pretty good too, but sometimes i don't want to leave vim to get the response

2014-04-28 11:35:43	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah
2014-04-28 11:35:46	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	some samples
2014-04-28 13:13:19	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i found a way to have zsh change my environment variables depending on the directory i'm in
2014-04-28 13:13:51	jackhxs	hmm how could that be used
2014-04-28 13:14:13	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so, for instance
2014-04-28 13:14:21	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	if i had the AWS access keys in environment variables
2014-04-28 13:14:42	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	I could have them automatically swapped when i was in a project that worked on LI Uploads vs. conversion
2014-04-28 13:14:47	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	since those use different keys
2014-04-28 13:15:12	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so cd <linkedin uploads dir> changes the environment vars for the keys
2014-04-28 13:15:42	jackhxs	i see
2014-04-28 13:18:38	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	also, shit, the increase in API requests today
2014-04-28 13:18:46	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	think they're all related?
2014-04-28 13:21:13	jackhxs	have you been getting those emails before?
2014-04-28 13:21:22	jackhxs	i only started getting them like on friday
2014-04-28 13:21:33	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yes, but the number of actual requests is usually small
2014-04-28 13:22:04	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	7 since Friday
2014-04-28 13:22:41	jackhxs	so the earliest i have is apr 25
2014-04-28 13:23:14	jackhxs	i thought it was a new automated email
2014-04-28 13:24:08	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	well, most of what i was getting on that list was spam and maybe one or two requests a week
2014-04-28 13:59:44	jackhxs	lol ran out of memory building youcompleteme

2014-04-28 14:10:09	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	pulseaudio is just the daemon that manages playing sounds and whatnot
2014-04-28 14:10:26	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	also you probably need all chrome processes
2014-04-28 14:10:34	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	since each tab is a separate process
2014-04-28 14:10:59	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i usually find that after a while chrome is using several gigabyte
2014-04-28 14:11:04	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	gigabytes*
2014-04-28 14:11:39	jackhxs	damn chrome
2014-04-28 14:13:21	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so yeah, it's about the same memory footprint as firefox, it's just hidden across all processes
2014-04-28 14:13:41	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	there needs to be a command-line tool that aggregates chrome memory usage
2014-04-28 14:14:33	jackhxs	or automatically kill chrome and restart it every now and then
2014-04-28 14:15:07	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	well, that would suck if you were using it, but yeah
2014-04-28 14:15:42	jackhxs	well you can probably make it smart enough to not do that
2014-04-28 15:06:25	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so did you get ultisnips working?
2014-04-28 15:06:35	jackhxs	ya

2014-04-28 15:08:02	jackhxs	whats this
2014-04-28 15:08:09	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	it's a terminal sharing thing
2014-04-28 15:08:19	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i was going to show you that i found my php snippets from my last job

2014-04-28 17:38:33	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	(you need pip though)
2014-04-28 17:39:49	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	you would do csvcut -n filename to get a list of the columns (assigned numbers)
2014-04-28 17:40:12	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	then csvcut -c 1,7,8 filename to get just columns 1, 7, and 8
2014-04-28 17:40:28	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so csvcut -c 1,7,8 > newcsv

2014-05-19 13:04:52	jackhxs	o
2014-05-19 13:06:28	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i should probably just check my stuff in, though i don't think i want it in contrib (since that's still svn)
2014-05-19 13:06:38	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i'd prefer the git gem files discovery
2014-05-19 13:09:10	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	the nice thing about clush is that it will group results that are the same
2014-05-19 13:09:33	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so if you executed 'ls' on a bunch of similar machines, you would get only one set of output
2014-05-19 13:09:43	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	or a set of output for every subset of machines that was different
2014-05-19 13:15:11	jackhxs	i see
2014-05-19 13:15:21	jackhxs	that inline option you added yourself?
2014-05-19 13:15:43	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah, it's not an option to the aws command
2014-05-19 13:15:52	jackhxs	damn
2014-05-19 13:18:17	jackhxs	fuk it ill just pipe to paste -sd, for now
2014-05-19 13:18:25	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	lol
2014-05-19 13:25:55	jackhxs	doesnt look like theres a way to count the results is there?
2014-05-19 13:26:12	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	depends
2014-05-19 13:26:21	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	what are you trying to count? just the number of lines returned?
2014-05-19 13:27:15	jackhxs	like if i run this
2014-05-19 13:27:17	jackhxs	ec2_role pdf2swfFactoryRole | paste -sd, | xargs -I hosts clush -w hosts -b status pdf2swf
2014-05-19 13:27:28	jackhxs	i wanna see how many have "pdf2swf stop/waiting"
2014-05-19 13:28:00	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i see
2014-05-19 13:28:49	jackhxs	o wait
2014-05-19 13:28:50	jackhxs	nvm
2014-05-19 13:28:53	jackhxs	it tells me lol
2014-05-19 13:28:55	jackhxs	im blind
2014-05-19 13:30:03	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	lol
2014-05-19 13:32:54	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	right, since you have the output grouped with -b
2014-05-19 13:33:04	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	without that it would just output as it got data
2014-05-19 13:44:29	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	msl aws instances -i -r pdf2swfFactoryRole | xargs -I hosts clush -l root -w hosts --color=never status pdf2swf | grep -c 'stop'
2014-05-19 13:44:35	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	if you just wanted the number back

2014-05-22 16:01:32	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	my friend was using it to stream dark souls II to his macbook air
2014-05-22 16:02:28	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	he said it worked pretty well
2014-05-22 16:02:57	jackhxs	i see
2014-05-22 16:03:20	jackhxs	not really useful for me now, cuz my pc can run pretty much everything lol
2014-05-22 16:03:33	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah, but is useful if you have more than one computer
2014-05-22 16:03:55	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	like say you had one with a monitor mounted over your bed but it was mostly booted to the linux partition....
2014-05-22 16:04:03	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	then you could stream PC games to the linux box

2014-05-27 14:47:06	jackhxs	is it supposed to be @!attribute?
2014-05-27 14:47:16	jackhxs	according to yardoc documentation
2014-05-27 14:48:03	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	Yeah, if it does not immediately preceded an attr definition
2014-05-27 14:48:26	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	Precede*
2014-05-27 14:50:57	jackhxs	@! is the correct syntax right?
2014-05-27 14:51:04	jackhxs	you have !@ in upload_token.rb
2014-05-27 14:51:07	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	yeah
2014-05-27 17:31:24	jackhxs	did you run into this when running webapp tests?
2014-05-27 17:31:25	jackhxs	Failed to connect to a master node at stgmongodb01:27017 (Mongo::ConnectionFailure)
2014-05-27 17:32:47	jackhxs	its because my hacky /etc/hosts file has stgmongodb01.sl.ss
2014-05-27 17:33:15	jackhxs	it only knows about hosts with .sl.ss suffix
2014-05-27 17:50:08	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	hmmm
2014-05-27 17:50:15	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	Did not have that problem
2014-05-27 17:50:40	jackhxs	dam
2014-05-27 17:52:14	jackhxs	actually seems like a different problem
2014-05-27 17:52:38	jackhxs	its trying to connect to that mongo host, even without the mongodb.yml
2014-05-27 17:52:52	jackhxs	whats the command you use to run the specs?
2014-05-27 17:55:21	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/specs
2014-05-27 17:55:48	jackhxs	ya thats what im doing
2014-05-27 18:03:24	jackhxs	o it was mongoid.yml
2014-05-27 18:03:41	jackhxs	had to add .sl.ss to it
2014-05-27 18:04:29	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	okay
2014-05-27 18:04:41	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	though you shouldn't need to hit production for a test
2014-05-27 18:05:35	jackhxs	its not, production is mongomasterdb01

2014-07-07 14:10:46	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	did you make your desktop request before you went on vacation?
2014-07-07 14:10:53	jackhxs	ya
2014-07-07 14:11:17	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	well, i have pretty much everything working
2014-07-07 14:11:35	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	though i did have to build tree manually, as ridiculous as that sounds
2014-07-07 14:13:22	jackhxs	tower has been provisioned on july 1st
2014-07-07 14:13:29	jackhxs	it has been dropped off to shipping apparently
2014-07-07 14:13:44	jackhxs	and btw, ups lost my package with my new credit card
2014-07-07 14:14:43	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	again?
2014-07-07 14:14:49	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i feel like they've been doing that a lot
2014-07-07 14:15:10	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i suggest sweet-talking some customer service person asking if they can make a one-time delivery to the office
2014-07-07 14:15:41	jackhxs	i got them to cancel the card and make a new one, and send it to the office
2014-07-07 14:15:51	jackhxs	and UPS is doing a "formal investigation"
2014-07-07 14:15:51	jackhxs	lol
2014-07-07 14:16:08	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	lol
2014-07-07 14:20:14	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i got my vpn status to show up in xmobar
2014-07-07 14:20:24	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so i don't have to do a nmcli con list to check
2014-07-07 14:20:59	jackhxs	how do you connect to vpn
2014-07-07 14:21:21	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so i set up the vpn stuff, then nmcli con up id slvpn
2014-07-07 14:21:42	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i have a script that wraps it so i can just do "vpn up" or "vpn down"
2014-07-07 14:22:14	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	and they way i have it set up it only forwards 10.* IP addresses through
2014-07-07 14:22:26	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so when i disconnect i don't get disconnected from other things using the network
2014-07-07 14:22:43	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	still no linkedin dns though :/
2014-07-07 14:23:14	jackhxs	so you cant go on jira?
2014-07-07 14:23:26	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	not while connected, unfortunately
2014-07-07 14:23:47	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i imagine because it's on a nat address as well
2014-07-07 14:23:51	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	or the nameserver is whatever
2014-07-07 14:24:02	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i can just use my laptop if necessary to have both on
2014-07-07 14:24:09	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i bought a usb switch

2014-07-07 14:26:12	jackhxs	is this related to you and amol's stuff?
2014-07-07 14:26:37	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	maybe, from his earlier logrotate change
