2014-04-07 15:34:34	matt	is getting at the currently logged in user "current_user" or "session_user" ?
2014-04-07 15:34:47	toby	matt: depends on context
2014-04-07 15:34:55	toby	matt: session_user
2014-04-07 15:35:19	matt	so if i were writing a non-api controller, to get at the logged in user would be session_user
2014-04-07 15:35:32	toby	matt: yes
2014-04-07 15:35:51	matt	and do we have a before filter for ensuring a session_user for certain actions?
2014-04-07 15:36:54	toby	matt: something like login_required (lib/login_system.rb)?
2014-04-07 15:37:19	toby	matt: actually, I'm not sure I trust that after looking at it
2014-04-07 15:38:05	toby	matt: well, it looks usable
2014-04-07 15:38:17	matt	hahah
2014-04-07 15:38:27	matt	alright, i'll see if anyone uses it
2014-04-07 15:38:40	matt	i suppose our standard is "if session_user ..."

2014-04-07 15:44:45	casey	hmm, what do you do when you come across uncommitted changes you made 6 months ago
2014-04-07 16:27:06	Francisco	casey: immediately delete them?
2014-04-07 16:27:25	toby	casey: blindly commit them, because they are vintage
2014-04-07 16:28:02	Francisco	casey: add them as suggestions to a completely unrelated code review?
2014-04-07 16:28:57	casey	i like either option, since it involves fluentd test code

2014-04-10 14:28:28	matt	can anyone tell me what the difference is between upload type 9 (ApiFile) and upload type 14 (ApiUrl) is?
2014-04-10 14:29:25	KCA	matt: file post vs url post
2014-04-10 14:29:43	KCA	you can upload a file directly or a url pointing to an http file download url
2014-04-10 14:29:50	matt	KCA: so is the url post upload to s3 first then give us a url?
2014-04-10 14:29:52	matt	okay
2014-04-10 14:30:12	matt	so if i need to use an upload type for the new upload api, should i create a new upload type?
2014-04-10 14:30:32	KCA	matt: ApiFile should work
2014-04-10 14:30:43	KCA	if the upload contains the file
2014-04-10 14:31:44	matt	it's a different process: request upload_token -> get upload token and upload url -> upload to upload url -> post back with upload token to complete
2014-04-10 14:31:51	matt	maybe i should add the "token" type

2014-04-10 14:50:26	apoorvi	matt: I think upload type is now being used to track metrics, i.e where are uploads coming from
2014-04-10 14:50:37	apoorvi	so it will be good to have a separate type
2014-04-10 14:53:52	matt	apoorvi: okay
2014-04-10 14:54:15	casey	foos?
2014-04-10 14:54:24	matt	also, Preslideshow has an uploaded_by field that doesn't seem to be set to anything meaningful (the parameter parsing defaults it to 1)
2014-04-10 14:54:45	matt	does uploaded_by refer to the user that uploaded it?
2014-04-10 14:54:48	matt	or some other thing?

2014-04-24 14:51:14	AnaMaria	does anyone know what superuser_category_order and user_type in slideshow_categories_map are for ?
2014-04-24 14:53:06	matt	anyone know what the app_name field of the Slideshows table is used for/means? It's a varchar(3) and defaults to 'ss'
2014-04-24 14:54:21	mark	did you both use git log/blame?
2014-04-24 14:54:29	toby	matt: we had external apps that allowed slideshow uploads from those
2014-04-24 14:55:12	toby	matt: I think all those external platform apps are dead
2014-04-24 14:55:27	matt	i see, so is this field generally unused? i.e. i could use it to indicate an upload from haikudeck?
2014-04-24 14:56:31	apoorvi	matt: What about the field uplaodtype
2014-04-24 14:56:38	apoorvi	uploadtype*
2014-04-24 14:56:50	toby	matt: I don't think the app_name was originally intended like that
2014-04-24 14:57:08	toby	matt: as I think we originally didn't show those slideshows on the main site
2014-04-24 14:57:34	AnaMaria	Mark: I did, but the migration made to add the slideshow_category_map shows that toby added it. It doesn't go further. Just asking in case somebody will know anything about that.
2014-04-24 14:59:13	matt	creating a new upload type for each third party would be a little strange, but yeah, we could do that. Currently the upload type is "UploadToken" when using the new api

2014-04-24 15:03:02	AnaMaria	haha toby you should take a look to the categorize.rb file in script repo, and go to complain thread
2014-04-24 15:03:41	mark	toby: the integration test
2014-04-24 15:04:01	toby	mark: you should be reviewing that one anyways, as technically, you broke it

2014-04-25 11:25:41	KCA1	why is the action different?
2014-04-25 11:25:59	toby	KCA1: well, I guess mobile_login is/was optimized for a mobile experience and the original login wasn't responsive
2014-04-25 11:26:01	KCA1	the logic for mobile login is like half as long
2014-04-25 11:26:17	KCA1	and gets rid of a bunch of safety checks
2014-04-25 11:26:21	chris	haha
2014-04-25 11:26:25	KCA1	like rate limiting and checking for post request

2014-04-25 11:33:40	chris	KCA, I thought homogenous environments are bad for security? Makes sense to have multiple different versions of security checks then
2014-04-25 11:34:02	chris	this way, when they hack /login, mobile login is still safe

2014-05-23 13:20:01	Jack	ill play
2014-05-23 13:28:36	toby	were all those ec2-nohost alerts on https://noc.slideshare.com/nagios/cgi-bin/status.cgi?host=all&type=detail&servicestatustypes=16&hoststatustypes=3&serviceprops=42 caused by Sylvain running Puppet?
2014-05-23 13:28:55	Sylvain	toby I think yes
2014-05-23 13:29:14	toby	Sylvain: sorry, I shouldn't have said "caused", maybe "triggered" instead
2014-05-23 13:29:14	Sylvain	I killed a bunch of them which were "staging" and only use to test skynet controller staging
2014-05-23 13:29:30	Sylvain	toby no worries
2014-05-23 13:29:32	toby	Sylvain: do I need to look at them as part of my viking duties now?
2014-05-23 13:29:37	Sylvain	toby are you back in the ops team?
2014-05-23 13:29:39	Sylvain	lol
2014-05-23 13:29:39	Sylvain	no don't bother
2014-05-23 13:29:42	toby	no, viking duty
2014-05-23 13:29:45	Sylvain	I'll taking care about it
2014-05-23 13:29:49	Sylvain	ah
2014-05-23 13:29:55	Sylvain	no don't bother
2014-05-23 13:30:04	toby	Sylvain: ok, thanks, but I think I would take ops (only SoftLayer) over viking duty
2014-05-23 13:30:43	Sylvain	toby if you want we can make a deal, you take my weekend on call incidents on webapp, I take you the conversion viking duty ;P
2014-05-23 13:30:56	Sylvain	may be we need to ask manager casey1 and chris about this deal ;P
2014-05-23 13:31:18	toby	Sylvain: that is very tempting
2014-05-23 13:31:39	toby	Sylvain: but I would have to get more emails
2014-05-23 13:31:47	toby	Sylvain: so not sure
2014-05-23 13:31:58	casey1	you could just join ops
2014-05-23 13:32:10	Sylvain	JOIN THE FORCE
2014-05-23 13:32:13	casey1	we just escalate conversion alerts to conversion devs
2014-05-23 13:32:20	casey1	you wouldn't have to touch windows again
2014-05-23 13:32:23	Sylvain	"shhhhhh ssssshhhhh shhhhh" (darth vader sound)
2014-05-23 13:32:43	Sylvain	matt:  is clearly the new windows expert anyway
2014-05-23 13:33:03	Sylvain	see pdf2html alert gone
2014-05-23 13:33:18	Sylvain	OK now there is antivirus AND resource, fine!
2014-05-23 13:42:44	Sylvain	so I cleaned up all puppet alert but what do you think of this devphpapp02_check_http
2014-05-23 13:42:48	Sylvain	alert that we have since 102d toby?
2014-05-23 13:43:05	toby	Sylvain: conversion Delhi (maybe Deepti)
2014-05-23 13:43:19	toby	Sylvain: as they needed to check pptfactory_on_web on staging (I think for porting it to Ruby 2.0)
2014-05-23 13:43:39	Sylvain	but it's down since 104d
2014-05-23 13:43:43	toby	Sylvain: but I'm not even sure why we have a http check on devphpapp02
2014-05-23 13:43:55	Sylvain	me neither, we might want to remove it?
2014-05-23 13:43:56	toby	as in I don't even know of web app/server it would even need
2014-05-23 13:44:21	toby	Sylvain: depends on how it was added (maybe it was part of a hostgroup that somehow is needed on production)
