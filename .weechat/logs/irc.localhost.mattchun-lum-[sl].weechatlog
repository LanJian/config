2014-03-28 15:35:16	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	i use a modified version of the doebi theme
2014-03-28 17:45:12	jackhxs	my nickname is showing as Jack_(ixz), you know what this means?
2014-03-28 17:45:27	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so Jack_ means that Jack wasn't available
2014-03-28 17:45:37	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	the ixz are your user modes
2014-03-28 17:45:51	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	they are only visible to you
2014-03-28 17:46:03	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	https://www.alien.net.au/irc/usermodes.html
2014-03-28 17:50:04	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	if you're still logged in through adium then Jack would be unavailable
2014-03-28 17:50:37	jackhxs	i was when i set my nickname
2014-03-28 17:50:40	jackhxs	now im logged out
2014-03-28 17:51:42	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	so you should be able to change your nick back
2014-03-28 17:52:13	jackhxs	kk got it, had to disconnect and reconnect
2014-03-28 17:52:24	jackhxs	but why am i in invisible mode?
2014-03-28 17:53:15	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	you should have just been able to do /nick Jack
2014-03-28 17:53:28	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	invisible mode means you won't show up if someone searches for all users on a server
2014-03-28 17:53:34	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	not that they can't see you in the channel
2014-03-28 17:53:50	jackhxs	i see
2014-03-28 17:53:56	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	it's a safety thing
2014-03-28 17:54:01	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	you can disable it
2014-03-28 17:54:18	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	 /help umode
2014-03-28 17:55:00	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	or whatever the actual command is (i've forgotten it)
2014-03-28 17:56:05	MattChun-Lum-[sl]	gotta catch a train
