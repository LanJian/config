2014-06-25 16:20:44	LucyLu-[fb]	Hey Jack, I have a couple of questions for housing. What is the approximate price range for places in San Fran or Palo Alto, do you know which place is cheaper?
2014-06-25 16:21:39	LucyLu-[fb]	Palantir is currently searching for a corporate housing spot for me, but i'm not sure if i can save money by looking myself?
2014-06-25 16:25:20	jackhxs	im sure palo alto would be cheaper than the city

2014-06-25 16:25:42	jackhxs	are you living by yourself?
2014-06-25 16:31:18	LucyLu-[fb]	ya all my friends are working in san fran unforunately so i don't know anyone else to live with
2014-06-25 16:32:17	LucyLu-[fb]	they haven't guaranteed me corporate housing because they are still looking, so i'm worried that i won't have a place in palo alto
2014-06-25 16:32:34	LucyLu-[fb]	i may live with my roomates and commute using the caltrain if i need to
2014-06-25 16:33:15	LucyLu-[fb]	do you know the area near Palantir? is it considered a quiet/safe neighbourhood?
2014-06-25 16:40:41	jackhxs	i only been there once, but it should be safe
2014-06-25 16:40:53	jackhxs	palantir is in downtown palo alto
2014-06-25 16:41:04	jackhxs	and right beside the caltrain
2014-06-25 16:41:42	jackhxs	so if you want quiet, you might want to look a bit further out from that spot
2014-06-25 16:43:33	jackhxs	palo alto is a nice area though, some good restaurants
2014-06-25 16:44:44	jackhxs	if i were you, i would live in palo alto instead of the city
2014-06-25 16:45:16	jackhxs	cuz the commute would be very long, and apartments near caltrain in SF are super expensive
2014-06-25 16:48:06	LucyLu-[fb]	ohhh ok then i will stick with palo alto, thanks for the info!
2014-06-25 17:26:26	jackhxs	no problem
