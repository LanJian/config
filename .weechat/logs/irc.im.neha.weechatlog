2014-07-09 16:07:21	neha	Hey
2014-07-09 16:07:33	jackhxs	hi
2014-07-09 16:07:34	neha	is there a quick way to get started with s3
2014-07-09 16:07:55	neha	i mean what all do I need to set up?
2014-07-09 16:09:23	jackhxs	do you have s3cmd?
2014-07-09 16:09:31	neha	i think so
2014-07-09 16:09:38	jackhxs	s3cmd is good for checking something quickly
2014-07-09 16:10:17	jackhxs	otherwise you want the aws-sdk gem
2014-07-09 16:10:27	neha	ok i have it installed - but some problem has occured in it
2014-07-09 16:14:09	jackhxs	where did you install s3cmd from?
2014-07-09 16:14:22	neha	don't know
2014-07-09 16:14:32	neha	perhaps port
2014-07-09 16:14:48	jackhxs	maybe its an old version
2014-07-09 16:14:57	jackhxs	can you try this http://s3tools.org/s3cmd?
2014-07-09 16:15:15	neha	ok
2014-07-09 16:16:18	neha	what version should i get?
2014-07-09 16:17:24	jackhxs	i have the latest, 1.5.0-beta1
2014-07-09 16:17:31	neha	ok
2014-07-09 16:21:46	neha	installed
2014-07-09 16:21:55	neha	i need to configure it now

2014-07-10 11:09:14	neha	Hey
2014-07-10 11:09:29	neha	when do we save files in s3 in multipart?
2014-07-10 11:09:50	neha	in the documentation I see that files over 5GB are stored multipart
2014-07-10 11:10:05	neha	can we configure this?
2014-07-10 11:10:17	jackhxs	as far as i know, we dont do multipart
