2014-05-07 09:57:57	@Jack	i am not sure what caused the alerts just now, when i started looking into it, the queues were going down
2014-05-07 09:58:32	@Jack	when did you spin up the new windows machines deepti?
2014-05-07 09:58:39	deepti	the machines went unreachable few hours back

2014-05-07 10:01:46	@Jack	i see the queues are back down now
2014-05-07 10:10:15	sshishir	guys Jack  and deepti conversion stuck ratio is getting back up 
2014-05-07 10:10:52	sshishir	i see the nagios alert again

2014-05-07 10:15:29	sshishir	SWF_INPUT_QUEUE_LEN is OK
2014-05-07 10:18:38	Jack	so the conversion stuck ratio is in warning for a while now
2014-05-07 10:18:54	sshishir	hey deepti i don't think this has anything to do with RE-UPLOAD not working
2014-05-07 10:19:06	chris	have we tried reprocessing stuck presentations?
2014-05-07 10:19:19	sshishir	 i think we will have to put them for reconversion 
2014-05-07 10:19:37	sshishir	ya  let me do that 
2014-05-07 10:19:50	chris	yeah, might make alert go away
2014-05-07 10:20:54	chris	So were there any changes deployed during delhi time? I'm just trying to get context
2014-05-07 10:23:24	sshishir	i dont think there were any changes. 
2014-05-07 10:23:51	sshishir	it was mostly EC2 instances become unreachable
2014-05-07 10:23:58	sshishir	deepti has droped a mail 
2014-05-07 10:24:20	sshishir	 @deepti can you shed some more light ? 
2014-05-07 10:26:37	deepti	I have put stuck slideshows for reconversion
2014-05-07 10:26:51	deepti	No changes were deployed
2014-05-07 10:27:26	deepti	only some ec2 machines become unreachble.. so i started new machines 
2014-05-07 11:02:22	sshishir	i think we are having a sperate issue in RE-UPLOAD

2014-05-07 11:30:14	Jack	hi deepti, the conversion stuck ratio is still critical
2014-05-07 11:30:18	Jack	do you have any ideas?
2014-05-07 11:30:48	deepti	i am looking in old factories
2014-05-07 11:31:06	deepti	it seems conversion is stuck due to s3 
2014-05-07 11:31:30	deepti	S3 says The difference between the request time and the current time is too large.
2014-05-07 11:32:49	Jack	ok this may be a ntp problem
2014-05-07 11:33:12	Jack	we may need to fix ntp on the win factories
2014-05-07 11:33:13	deepti	Uploading is failing due to this
2014-05-07 11:33:27	deepti	i saw this only on one machine
2014-05-07 11:33:46	deepti	that has the recent stuck slideshows
2014-05-07 11:33:55	deepti	what is this ntp issue
2014-05-07 11:34:51	Jack	so if the time on the machine is not set up correctly, when we upload to s3 with a timestamp, it may be rejected because of time discrepancy
2014-05-07 11:35:22	Jack	which machine did you see this on?
2014-05-07 11:36:00	deepti	ec2-54-224-32-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com

2014-05-07 11:39:57	deepti	process is running on it
2014-05-07 11:40:24	matt	so yeah, i guess it is the ntp issue
2014-05-07 11:41:04	deepti	i think because of this conversion remains in stuck state
2014-05-07 11:54:15	Jack	i resynched the time on winfactory9
2014-05-07 11:54:37	Jack	i'll start the program
2014-05-07 11:58:04	matt	i've requeued the slideshows from 30 minutes ago to yesterday morning
