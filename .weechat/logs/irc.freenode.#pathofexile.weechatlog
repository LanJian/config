2014-04-08 15:39:44	@arc_	no, like i was trying to say, in order for some things to be morally codified, not everything has to be
2014-04-08 15:39:57	@arc_	nor does everything even need to be
2014-04-08 15:40:10	zid`	arc_: morality is easy if you avoid all the hard questions

2014-04-08 15:40:54	@arc_	so is the question can one be completely moral? because one can't be completely moral in a spiritual society
2014-04-08 15:41:47	zid`	arc_: The issue is whether you can arrive at a decision about whether is something is moral or not without outside influence.
2014-04-08 15:41:59	@arc_	the level of morality possible in a spiritual society should be equal to the level of morality possible in a secular society
2014-04-08 15:42:01	zid`	(I believe it to be completely non-possible)
