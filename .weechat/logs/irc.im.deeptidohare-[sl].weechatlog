2014-05-07 12:00:44	jackhxs	hey deepti
2014-05-07 12:00:58	DeeptiDohare-[sl]	hi 
2014-05-07 12:01:44	jackhxs	i started the program on winfactory9, it is now saying machine at full capacity
2014-05-07 12:01:52	jackhxs	although it still seem to be converting
2014-05-07 12:02:02	jackhxs	any ideas why this is happening?
2014-05-07 12:02:23	DeeptiDohare-[sl]	i have not worked on old windows… but this seems normal
2014-05-07 12:02:27	DeeptiDohare-[sl]	check the logs
2014-05-07 12:03:10	jackhxs	this used to be fixed by deleting the job files, but it does not fix it anymore
2014-05-07 12:04:23	DeeptiDohare-[sl]	hmmm
2014-05-07 12:05:38	DeeptiDohare-[sl]	need to investigate more
2014-05-07 12:05:40	DeeptiDohare-[sl]	:P
2014-05-07 12:06:49	jackhxs	ok we are recovering now, i think we are ok for now
2014-05-07 12:08:43	DeeptiDohare-[sl]	i hope this fix works
2014-05-07 12:09:48	jackhxs	ok its no longer throwing the machine at full capacity error anymore
2014-05-07 12:10:06	jackhxs	i think we are good for now
2014-05-07 12:10:12	DeeptiDohare-[sl]	:)
2014-05-07 12:10:22	jackhxs	sorry to keep you up
