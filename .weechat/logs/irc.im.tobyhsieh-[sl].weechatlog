2014-04-10 14:44:32	jackhxs	what you need?
2014-04-10 14:44:39	TobyHsieh-[sl]	an account that works
2014-04-10 14:44:49	TobyHsieh-[sl]	can I come over to explain my dillemma?
2014-04-10 14:44:54	jackhxs	sure

2014-04-10 14:59:15	TobyHsieh-[sl]	it works for that UUID
2014-04-10 14:59:48	jackhxs	hmmm
2014-04-10 15:00:01	jackhxs	can you give me one that doesnt work?

2014-04-10 15:08:33	TobyHsieh-[sl]	did s3cmd info work for the above?
2014-04-10 15:11:14	jackhxs	didnt work
2014-04-10 15:11:50	jackhxs	hmm the ones that dont work are old image it seems
2014-04-10 15:13:30	TobyHsieh-[sl]	mine above was created recently
2014-04-10 15:13:41	TobyHsieh-[sl]	like today
2014-04-10 15:13:45	jackhxs	o
2014-04-10 15:14:23	TobyHsieh-[sl]	oh
2014-04-10 15:14:29	TobyHsieh-[sl]	I think it is Yifu's cache-control thing
2014-04-10 15:19:50	TobyHsieh-[sl]	actually, nvm
2014-04-10 15:25:22	jackhxs	i think its a bug in linkedin uploads
2014-04-10 15:25:33	jackhxs	lib/s3_uploader.rb:131
2014-04-10 15:25:44	jackhxs	we are not setting the original_acl
2014-04-10 15:25:59	TobyHsieh-[sl]	yeah, I thought that was intentional though
2014-04-10 15:26:06	TobyHsieh-[sl]	as we maybe wanted the original to be private?
2014-04-24 15:00:59	jackhxs	do i have to be compatible with both 1.8 and 1.9?
2014-04-24 15:01:19	TobyHsieh-[sl]	no, just something to keep in mind
2014-04-24 15:01:26	TobyHsieh-[sl]	add a TODO if you don't want to handle that now
2014-04-24 15:02:37	jackhxs	i want it to work now on softlayer and EC2
2014-04-24 15:02:44	jackhxs	we are still using 1.8 on them right?
2014-04-24 15:55:24	TobyHsieh-[sl]	some servers in SoftLayer use Ruby 1.9 (like socialapi), but I think most of the servers your gem will deal w/ use 1.8
2014-04-24 15:55:27	TobyHsieh-[sl]	not sure about EC2
2014-04-24 15:56:45	jackhxs	ok

2014-04-28 10:35:05	jackhxs	sure, you wanna do it now?
2014-04-28 10:35:16	TobyHsieh-[sl]	yeah, now works
2014-04-28 10:35:41	TobyHsieh-[sl]	should I come over?
2014-04-28 11:53:28	TobyHsieh-[sl]	you don't need to reply to those "has applied for an API key" emails
2014-04-28 11:53:37	TobyHsieh-[sl]	those are automated whenever someone creates an API account
2014-04-28 11:55:01	jackhxs	hmm i only need to do the ones where they explicitly ask for access?
2014-04-28 11:55:09	TobyHsieh-[sl]	I guess

2014-05-05 13:16:07	TobyHsieh-[sl]	there are like 2 conflicting puppetdoc styles
2014-05-05 13:16:25	TobyHsieh-[sl]	I don't know which one we officially adhere to, so maybe just pick one reasonable one that you see
