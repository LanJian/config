2014-05-21 14:17:41	Kyle	wait. Is someone deploying to production that wants to take my change or should I just do it after?
2014-05-21 14:18:14	mark	Kyle: I can take yours to prod if my changes are good
2014-05-21 14:18:32	Kyle	Yeah they are good. Just waiting for cruise control to finish
2014-05-21 14:18:45	Kyle	didn't deploy to staging, but there is nothing I can test on staging anyway
2014-05-21 14:19:13	mark	oh
2014-05-21 14:19:33	Kyle	does that change things?
2014-05-21 14:19:37	mark	in general, you should still test on staging to make sure slideview isn't broken (despite it doesn't appear to be)
2014-05-21 14:19:49	mark	appear to be a potential issue*
2014-05-21 14:19:50	Kyle	ok
2014-05-21 14:20:10	Kyle	so should I deploy to staging and let you know once I'm done with that and then you can take it to prod when you're ready?
2014-05-21 14:20:24	mark	yeah, but my deploy hasn't finished yet and it's risky
2014-05-21 14:20:29	mark	so let me test some stuff first
2014-05-21 14:20:39	Kyle	Ok. Let me know when I should deploy to staging
